Wal-Mart Takes a Social Stand

Despite its rural Southern roots, the world’s largest retailer is a vocal supporter of gay marriage and taking down the Confederate flag.

By its own optimistic estimates, Wal-Mart Stores will need several more years to shake off sluggish growth and modernize its business model. But the company is moving a lot faster to improve its brand through very public initiatives on a number of high-profile issues.

In June, in the wake of the massacre of nine African-Americans at a Bible study session in a historic Charleston, South Carolina, church, Wal-Mart announced it would cease sales of Confederate flag-related items both in its stores and on its website. That quickly led other retailers — including Amazon.com, eBay and Sears Holdings Corp. — to follow suit.

In February, Wal-Mart waded into the growing national debate over income inequality by announcing raises for more than one third of its associates, as it calls employees. That was an unexpected move for a company that often is a magnet for bitter complaints from labor unions for opposing attempts to organize its employees and for its tight-fisted wage policies, which in the past have forced some part-time Wal-Mart workers to depend on food stamps.

But with almost 1.3 million people on its U.S. payroll, Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the country. So other jumbo companies, such as Target Corp. and McDonald's Corp., soon followed with wage hikes of their own.

More controversial has been Wal-Mart's stand in favor of gay marriage. In late March the company posted a Twitter feed from CEO Doug McMillon asking Asa Hutchinson, governor of Arkansas, Wal-Mart's home state, not to sign a so-called religious freedom bill that could have allowed discrimination against gays and lesbians. The governor did not sign the bill, and Wal-Mart's position seemed to reverberate in other states considering similar legislation.

"It certainly gets noticed when the biggest retailer in the world takes on issues on which it was perceived to be on the other side of the table," says Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Trussell. "We are seeing a very focused and purposeful strategy to have Wal-Mart become a leader on important social issues."

Wal-Mart officials say they had no choice. "We don't really want to be in politics," says CFO Charles Holley Jr. "But there are some issues that require us to step up, especially when they affect our associates and customers."

Clearly, there are bottom-line considerations as well. Many Wal-Mart customers are low-income consumers who would likely spend more at the company's Supercenters if they benefited from a national uptick in wages. Gay and lesbian consumers have total buying power of more than $800 billion annually, according to Witeck Communications, a firm that tracks their wealth.

Though Wal-Mart's social stands have received a windfall of publicity of late, the company has pushed lower-key initiatives in other areas, like environmental sustainability, for years. In 2007, Wal-Mart announced a plan to sell 100 million compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which it said would conserve the equivalent of energy needed to power 450,000 single-family homes over the lifetime of those squiggly bulbs.

"I was an accountant, and I remember thinking, 'This is just PR,'" Holley recalls. He changed his mind when the 100 million bulbs were sold in only nine months instead of the targeted 12. "It was great for business, customers, the environment and for shareholders," says the CFO.

Still ahead is a push for the adoption of higher animal welfare standards by Wal-Mart's suppliers of meat, poultry and seafood products. In May the retailer called for the lower use of antibiotics and more living space for farm animals and fish. For now the guidelines are voluntary and have no set deadline. But when the largest grocer in the land speaks, farmers and fishermen listen.

The Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, Today, over-turned a Tennessee federal district court ruling, thereby allowing plaintiffs in a gender discrimination regional class action to initiate their suit against Wal-Mart. The ruling does not certify the class, but allows the court action to begin. Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC serves as counsel for the plaintiffs.

David Garrison of Barrett Johnston, the firm that filed the original suit in Tennessee "We applaud the court for allowing these hard-working women to join together to pursue their claims of pay and promotion discrimination against Wal-Mart," said Joseph M. Sellers of Cohen Milstein. Cohen Milstein is co-counsel in the case. "Wal-Mart's persistent pattern of gender discrimination can be devastating for women and their families".

The complaint Phipps, et al. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. seeks to end Wal-Mart's discriminatory practices for female employees and to receive punitive damages for the women in the class. Plaintiffs charge that Wal-Martdiscriminated against female employees in stores throughout its Region 43, which centres in Tennessee and also includes parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, and Mississippi. Cohen Milstein is co-counsel filed the original class action against the giant retailer.

The named plaintiffs in the Region 43 case are Cheryl Phipps, of Covington, Tenn., employed by Wal-Mart for 11 years; Bobbi Millner, of Jackson, Tenn., employed by Wal-Mart for 26 years; and Shawn Gibbons, a Wal-Mart employee since 1993. The named plaintiffs seek to represent thousands of current and former women employees with the exception of store managers and pharmacists of Wal-Mart stores in Region 43. The class includes women who worked at Wal-Mart stores and were subject to pay and promotion discrimination at any time since Dec. 26, 1998.

In June 2011, Phipps v. Wal-Mart is the third regional discrimination case lodged against Wal-Mart since the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling on the national class action against the retailer and issued new guidelines for class actions and Title VII Civil Rights Act employment discrimination cases. In October 2011, two regional complaints were filed - Dukes, et al. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, and Odle, et al. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., in U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas, Dallas.

Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC, founded in 1969, is a national leader in plaintiff class action lawsuits and litigation. As one of the premier firms in the country handling major complex cases, Cohen Milstein, with 80 attorneys, has offices in Washington, D.C., New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., and Denver, Colo.

On behalf of individuals and organizations, Barrett Johnston Martin & Garrison, LLC fights, on a wide range of legal matters. A substantial part of the practice is class action litigation, representing investors, consumers and employees in both state and federal court in Tennessee and across the country. These cases usually involve violations of federal securities law, the Employment Retirement Income and Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), federal antitrust law, state consumer and antitrust law, employment discrimination and derivative litigation.

Court Urges SEC To Clarify Rules For Shareholder Input

IT WAS Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton's own words on the key to a successful business that led to a federal appellate court's determination that the company's sale of high-capacity firearms was done in the ordinary course of business and free from shareholder input.

But in so ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit suggested the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission clarify its rules on when shareholders' social policy initiatives can trump the commission's bid to stem shareholder interference with ordinary business decisions.

Two-and-a-half months after ruling in Wal-Mart's favor in its proxy fight with shareholder Trinity Wall Street, the Third Circuit issued a detailed opinion explaining why Trinity had no right to include in the company's annual proxy statement a proposal that Wal-Mart's board establish policies for determining whether it should sell the guns and other products that endanger public safety.

"'The secret of successful retailing is to give your customers what they want,'" Judge Thomas L. Ambro said at the start of the majority opinion, quoting Walton. "This case involves one shareholder's attempt to affect how Wal-Mart goes about doing that."

The Third Circuit had to make a quick ruling after hearing oral arguments in April because Wal-Mart was facing a deadline for sending its annual proxy statement to the printer. About a week after arguments, the court issued an order reversing the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware's decision forcing Wal-Mart to include Trinity's proposal.

In its opinion Monday, the Third Circuit ruled the SEC's social policy exception to its ordinary business exclusion does not apply to Trinity's efforts to set policies for the sale of dangerous products.

"For a policy issue here to transcend Wal-Mart's business operations, it must target something more than the choosing of one among tens of thousands of products it sells," Ambro said.

But the judge gave some words of advice to the SEC on clarifying its rules for interpreting when an exception to an exclusion is appropriate.

"For those who labor with the ordinary business exclusion and a social-policy exception that requires not only significance but 'transcendence,' we empathize," Ambro said. "Despite the substantial uptick in proposals attempting to raise social policy issues that bat down the business operations bar, the SEC's last word on the subject came in the 1990s, and we have no hint that any change from it or Congress is forthcoming."

Ambro said the court has no doubt the SEC could collect data and views on the best direction for its regulatory policy and suggested it consider revising its regulation of proxy contests and issue fresh interpretive guidance.

Wal-Mart sells high-capacity firearms in about one-third of its 3,000 stores. Trinity's proposal sought the board's development and implementation of standards for management to use in deciding whether to sell a product that endangers public safety, has the potential to harm Wal-Mart's image or would reasonably be considered offensive to the family and community values core to the company's brand, Ambro said.

The SEC gave Wal-Mart a "noaction letter" stating there would be no enforcement action against the company if it omitted Trinity's proposal from the proxy statement. Trinity sought an injunction in Delaware federal court, which initially denied Trinity's request. But it later reconsidered that ruling, ultimately determining the ordinary business rule didn't apply because the proposal concerned the company's board rather than its management and focused principally on governance rather than how Wal-Mart decides what to sell.

Trinity had vowed to fight Wal-Mart's gun sales as part of an effort to decrease access to high-capacity rifles like the ones used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Wal-Mart said its decision to sell the guns was based on customer demand by hunters and sportsmen who use the guns responsibly.

Ambro said the ordinary business exclusion under the SEC's rule for barring shareholder proposals from proxy statements—Rule 14a-8—has been described as the "most perplexing" of the rule's exclusions. He said the term is not self-defining or consistent across corporate scenarios.

The SEC has provided near exclusive jurisprudence on the exclusion's application, Ambro said, detailing the commission's struggles between the 1970s and 1990s with giving effective guidance on the exclusion's applicability.

It was in 1997 that the SEC addressed shareholder proposals that related to an ordinary business matter and a significant social issue. That was done in response to the SEC's supporting in 1995 the exclusion of a shareholder proposal asking for a prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation at Cracker Barrel Old Country Store. But the SEC ultimately failed to make any changes to the language of the rule at that time, Ambro said.

He said the court's determination on these issues needs to be handled on a case-by-case basis. He used a two-part analysis to determine if a proposal dealt with a company's ordinary business operations. First, he looked to the subject matter of the proposal and then determined whether it relates to the ordinary business operations of Wal-Mart.

The judge rejected Trinity's argument that the subject matter of its proposal was improving corporate governance through adopting a merchandizing policy.

"The subject matter of the proposal is instead its ultimate consequence—here a potential change in the way Wal-Mart decides which products to sell," Ambro said.

In looking at the second step, Ambro determined that subject matter goes to the core of Wal-Mart's daily business operations.

"A retailer's approach to its product offerings is the bread and butter of its business," Ambro said.

After determining the ordinary business exclusion applied, Ambro said the social policy exception to that rule did not apply because nothing about the proposal transcended Wal-Mart's day-to-day business operations.

Ambro crafted another two-part test to rule on the applicability of the social policy exception. Trinity won on the first piece, with the court declaring that Trinity's proposal addressed a "sufficiently significant policy." Concurring Judge Patty Shwartz said in her opinion that she would have denied the social policy exception at that first step of the test, finding the proposal did not raise a significant social policy.

The majority rejected the exception at the second prong of its analysis, finding the proposal targeted a retailer-consumer interaction that did not "transcend" in this case Wal-Mart's ordinary business operations. The decision to sell certain things in certain stores is typically made by management, the court said.

"Wal-Mart serves different Americas with different values," Ambro said, noting how management addresses those varied desires across the urban and rural areas it serves is not a board-level issue.

Judge Thomas I. Vanaskie joined in the majority as well as a portion of Shwartz's concurring opinion. Shwartz said she wrote separately because she thought the test the majority created for the social policy exception could remove shareholder oversight from a number of company actions that shareholders should oversee.

Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in Los Angeles argued the case on behalf of Wal-Mart.

He said that while he already knew the bottom-line ruling, having this detailed of an opinion was a welcome addition to the limited case law from the circuit courts on this issue. Boutrous said the court crafted the appropriate tests and got to the core of the division of roles among shareholders, the board and management. He said it was an important decision in an active area of corporate governance.

Joel Friedlander of Friedlander & Gorris in Wilmington argued on behalf of Trinity. He did not return a call seeking comment.

SOCIAL POLICY VERSUS BUSINESS OPERATIONS

Wal-Mart sells high-capacity firearms in about one-third of its 3,000 stores. Trinity's proposal sought the board's development and implementation of standards for management to use in deciding whether to sell a product that endangers public safety, has the potential to harm Wal-Mart's image or would reasonably be considered offensive to the family and community values core to the company's brand, Ambro said.

Big plans to overhaul township economies

RADICAL CHANGES TARGET PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY

We want to ensure blacks produce flour they use to make fat cakes

LEBOGANG Maile grew up in “Dark City” – Alexandra. At the time it did not have electricity.

Like all townships, Alexandra is home to consumers of goods and services. Very little, if anything, is produced in townships and supplied to the mainstream economy.

Now, the MEC for economic development and agriculture, Maile says the government is not “only talking radical, but also acting radical” to change the situation.

The plan is to get township entrepreneurs to become producers of goods and services.

If this were to succeed, it would be a game changer.

Townships were constructed by the apartheid system to house cheap labour for white-owned companies, particularly mines. But they were linked to the homelands where some of the cheap black labour came from.

The growth of the labour force meant the growth of the black consumer market in the townships.

Entrepreneurial flair was destroyed through a number of discriminatory laws that sought to confine blacks to only two things: consumer and labourer.

As part of changing this economic system – which remains largely intact with some negligible changes – Maile and his team have met about 50000 township entrepreneurs.

The businessmen and women spoke about the obstacles they faced in growing their businesses.

They wanted help from the government to access funding, office space, land and Internet.

Lack of finance is a big hindrance for budding township retailers because they are unable to buy bulk, a fact that has made them relatively uncompetitive, compared with foreigners who club together to negotiate discounts with suppliers.

“Following the road show, we put together a strategy which the government has adopted. We want to convert townships from being places of consumption to becoming centres of production,” says Maile.

To solve the shortage of land, the government is considering making available suitable land owned by different spheres of government, including municipalities in the townships.

But Maile admits that some government projects tend to raise hopes, only to fail. The R1.3-billion Alexandra renewal project is one example. Maile says there is no room to fail this time.

“We have stopped talking radical but we are acting radical. We will change laws if they are an obstacle,” he says.

He has held meetings with 11 big businesses, ranging from IT companies to the major four banks, to support his township economy strategy.

He has signed a memorandum of agreement with the South African Banking Association to establish a grey fund that will be accessed by small businesses.

The government is also considering changing procurement patterns.

“In our health department we have already started to do analysis on what are we buying, what are we spending our money on.”

Most of the equipment used in the health sector – including surgical gloves, bandages, musks and some theatre clothes – is imported.

“Some of these things we can manufacture locally and create jobs. This is the space we want to create for the township economy,” he says.

“We are giving direct tenders to black-owned companies but also focusing on manufacturing.

“We are interested in ensuring that black people produce flour that they use to make the fat cakes they sell.”

The spaza shops have to graduate to the next level. Maile has pioneered a deal with Massmart – owner of Game and Makro – to provide spaza shops with at least 60% of the stock needs as part of the company’s enterprise development programme.

“They [spaza shops] will buy in bulk from from Massmart. We are looking at spending our school feeding budget of about 2000 schools at spaza shops. The school will buy groceries or whatever it needs from spaza shops closer to the school.

“We linked them with Massmart so that they have capacity to buy in bulk but they will buy with their own money.”

But whether the products supplied to schools via spaza shops will be procured from black producers is something Maile’s department should do well to monitor.

A pilot project has started in six townships where spaza owners are buying supplies from Massmart.

He is not so naive as to think that there won’t be people who will try to manipulate the system, including fronting for the foreigners that are running most spaza shops in the townships.

“Operation Fiela has started to get rid of illegal people and is doing a good job,” he says.

The provincial government with the SA Revenue Service and the department of trade and industry is to help small businesses get registered and be tax compliant.

“This process will help us identify unregistered business and those run illegally. We need a reliable data base that cannot be manipulated.”

The government has to be able to account on how many township business people were empowered at the end of each year.

“Otherwise we will have failed if we cannot account.”

He’s right. The biggest challenge in South Africa’s governance system today is what appears to be a swearword to certain politicians: accountability.

(GlobeNewswire) - Today the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals over-turned a Tennessee federal district court ruling, thereby allowing plaintiffs in a gender discrimination regional class action to initiate their suit against Wal-Mart. The ruling does not certify the class, but allows the court action to begin. Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC serves as counsel for the plaintiffs.

Regional Class Action Against Wal-Mart to Proceed, Says Sixth District, U.S. Court of Appeals

Ruling May Affect Female Wal-Mart Employees in Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, and Mississippi

CINCINNATI, July 7, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals over-turned a Tennessee federal district court ruling, thereby allowing plaintiffs in a gender discrimination regional class action to initiate their suit against Wal-Mart. The ruling does not certify the class, but allows the court action to begin. Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC serves as counsel for the plaintiffs.

"We applaud the court for allowing these hard-working women to join together to pursue their claims of pay and promotion discrimination against Wal-Mart," said Joseph M. Sellers of Cohen Milstein. Cohen Milstein is co-counsel in the case. "Wal-Mart's persistent pattern of gender discrimination can be devastating for women and their families," David Garrison of Barrett Johnston, the firm that filed the original suit in Tennessee.

The complaint -- Phipps, et al. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. -- seeks to end Wal-Mart's discriminatory practices for female employees and to receive punitive damages for the women in the class. Plaintiffs charge that Wal-Martdiscriminated against female employees in stores throughout its Region 43, which centers in Tennessee and also includes parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, and Mississippi. Cohen Milstein is co-counsel filed the original class action against the giant retailer.

The named plaintiffs in the Region 43 case are Cheryl Phipps, of Covington, Tenn., employed by Wal-Mart for 11 years; Bobbi Millner, of Jackson, Tenn., employed by Wal-Mart for 26 years; and Shawn Gibbons, a Wal-Mart employee since 1993. The named plaintiffs seek to represent thousands of current and former women employees--with the exception of store managers and pharmacists--of Wal-Mart stores in Region 43. The class includes women who worked at Wal-Mart stores and were subject to pay and promotion discrimination at any time since Dec. 26, 1998.

Phipps v. Wal-Mart is the third regional discrimination case lodged against Wal-Mart since the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2011 reversed a lower court ruling on the national class action against the retailer and issued new guidelines for class actions and Title VII Civil Rights Act employment discrimination cases. In October 2011, two regional complaints were filed -- Dukes, et al. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, and Odle, et al. v.

Social consciousness is becoming good business

When Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers while announcing his presidential run, it wasn't his fellow Republicans, but companies such as NBCUniversal and Macy's that most closely held his feet to the fire.

And while South Carolina politicians debated whether the Confederate flag should come down at the state's capitol complex, Wal-Mart and Sears were already rushing to remove it from their shelves and Web sites.

Big businesses have lately been proactive, even aggressive, in taking a stand on the social and political issues that have given new fire to America's long-simmering culture wars. From trumpeting their support for same-sex marriage on social media to ­urging Congress to modernize the nation's immigration system, some of America's biggest brands are coming off the sidelines to wade into contentious policy debates, a change in posture that reflects shifting customer expectations.

"Consumers have been judging companies more and more by their social policies, their economic policies; that's become a big part of decision-making" of where they spend their money, said George Belch, a professor who studies marketing strategy at San Diego State University.

This shift is not just a feel-good measure, analysts said, but often good business.

When department store giant Macy's moved Wednesday to sever its business ties with Trump, the company said it was disappointed and distressed" by his "disparaging characterizations" of Mexican immigrants.

In a statement, Trump blamed the Macy's move on "pressure being put on them by outside sources." An online MoveOn.org petition calling for the end of Trump's line gained more than 728,000 signatures, and Latino advocacy group Presente.org demanded that the chain "take a stand against discrimination."

Trump also painted the breakup as partially his idea, in much the same way he did when, earlier this week, NBCUniversal parted ways with him, saying it would no longer air his Miss USA and Miss Universe beauty pageants.

"While selling Trump ties and shirts at Macy's is a small business in terms of dollar volume," Trump said, "my principles are far more important and therefore much more valuable."

Macy's had clear incentives to walk away from Trump, whose menswear line it has carried since 2004. The chain has been especially focused on winning over Latino shoppers. The company last month said its new private-label line designed to appeal to Latina women, a collaboration with Latina pop superstar Thalia Sodi, has so far been a "huge success."

Just as the Macy's move was decisive, so too were the actions taken last week by several retailers to get rid of merchandise bearing the Confederate flag after nine people were killed in a Charleston church in what authorities have called a racist hate crime.

While Sears did not carry any Confederate-flag-emblazoned items in its stores, it did have a small number of them on its online marketplace, which is open to third-party sellers. Chris Brathwaite, a company spokesman, said as soon as Sears heard rival Wal-Mart was pulling such items, it moved quickly to evaluate its own policies and ultimately decided to get rid of items with Confederate-flag imagery.

"It didn't take us long, we were out in front of [it]. We acted before people had the opportunity to react," Brathwaite said.

There has been a steady drumbeat of cases recently in which big businesses put their muscle behind a social issue.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in letters signed by Apple, McDonald's and Marriott, as well as hundreds of other businesses, urged Congress last year to swiftly modernize America's immigration system. When Apple chief executive Tim Cook publicly declared that he was gay, he reinforced the tech giant's position as a central voice on discrimination and human rights issues.

And few companies have shown this symbolic sweep as loudly and surprisingly as Wal-Mart, whose long reign as the world's biggest retailer has been largely marked by virtual silence on social issues.

So far this year, the Bentonville, Ark.-based company has vigorously fought against that state's religious freedom law, which critics said would have allowed businesses to refuse service to gay customers, banished Confederate-flag bandannas, swimsuits, belt buckles and other merchandise from its shelves.

Wal-Mart's resistance to the Arkansas legislation was credited with turning the political tide against the bill in its home state. It was later passed with amended language to address opponents concerns. Chief executive Doug McMillon, in a statement in March, said the law threatened to "undermine the spirit of inclusion . . . and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold."

The massive chain's visible resistance to the Confederate flag may yet bring broader impact. As Charles Fishman, author of "The Wal-Mart Effect," told The Washington Post last week, the company "is not just following the cultural conversation, they're shaping it."

Corporate America's new strategy toward social issues has been hatched at a time when social media is creating a real-time barometer for consumers' reactions to news events or product issues.

"In the past, decisions like this would've been a little bit more seat-of-the-pants," Belch said. "Today, every company has ­social-media monitoring tools in place" and "they're constantly out there looking for what's being said."

They're not just closely watching that social-media conversation, but in some cases, looking to be a part of it. Major brands including Gap, Target and Procter & Gamble took to Twitter last week with rainbow-bedecked messages expressing support for the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage.

To be sure, these companies are not necessarily walking out on an especially precarious limb when they offer up their support for social or political causes. For example, polls show about 60 percent of Americans support same-sex marriage.

And yet these moves are not without risks. Starbucks, for example, abandoned a campaign last year to have its baristas chat up customers about race relations at the checkout counter. When the initiative drew criticism from customers who didn't want a side of politics with their frappuccino, the company said workers no longer needed to write #racetogether on customers' coffee cups.

LAWSUITS arising out of the workplace are one of the fastest growing areas of litigation in the country today. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes (1) was anticipated bring the growth of class actions in the employment context under control. In the immediate aftermath of Dukes, commentators predicted that the decision would result in a significant, drastic reduction in employee driven class-action claims, (2) and Dukes unquestionably "raise[d] the bar for plaintiffs seeking class certification and, accordingly, constitute[d] a win for employers," because plaintiffs' attorneys now face, "much greater obstacles when pursuing class actions." (3)

The limitations to class action claims of discrimination provided in Dukes have had far-reaching implications for Title VII claims and class action lawsuits brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. But the landmark decision "has not led to the demise of the class action, or even a reduction in employment class actions." (4) Instead, the employment class action case has merely taken on a new face. Following Dukes, employment class actions are now comprised of a smaller, regional class and are framed more narrowly, "in terms of a single policy or practice that applies to the entire class." (5)

This article reviews Dukes and the circuit court employment class certification decisions that have evolved from it and other landmark Supreme Court decisions impacting employment related class actions. While the trend remains favorable to employers, four years after Dukes, plaintiffs attorneys have begun to have success with new tactics. As a result, the ultimate legacy of Dukes in the employment law context remains uncertain.

I. Dukes and its Predecessors

A. General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon (6)

In the post -Dukes era of class-action jurisprudence and analysis, it is nearly impossible to find an opinion or article that does not use the phrase "rigorous analysis," a phrase many lawyers associate with Dukes. Despite the spike in popularity of the phrase post-Dukes, it was not introduced by the Court in that decision, but was first coined more than twenty years earlier in General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon. In Falcon, the Court held, "a Title VII class action, like any other class action, may only be certified if the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied." (7)

In Falcon, like Dukes, the trial court certified an employment discrimination class action. The class included some members who were denied promotion allegedly because they were Mexican-American. Other members of the class were denied being hired altogether allegedly because of their race. All members were included in the same class based on an "across the board" rule that a named plaintiff employee complaining of one allegedly discriminatory practice could represent class members complaining of a different practice. (8) This across the board rule was based on a presumption that all the class claims were fairly encompassed within the named plaintiff's claim, satisfying Rule 23(a)(3) typicality. The Supreme Court rejected the rule and its presumption of discrimination. In reversing the Fifth Circuit's affirmation of class certification, the Court made clear that when considering class certification, "[a]ctual, not presumed, conformance with Rule 23(a) remains ... indispensable," and that "a Title VII class action, like any other class action, may only be certified if the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied." (10) The Court noted that in carrying out this mandate it "may be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question." (11)

The Court's opinion in Falcon signaled the potential for a shift in the Court's treatment of class certification. Unlike Dukes, Falcon did not have the impact on lower federal courts that its recent decisions indicate the Supreme Court intended, driven largely by a concern that courts would be too willing to decide questions of certification with an eye to the underlying merits of the case. In the years between Falcon and Dukes, class counsel and courts alike often relied on language in an earlier Supreme Court decision, Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, (12) to avoid reaching the merits at the class certification stage. In Eisen, the Court ruled that "nothing in either the language or history of Rule 23 ... gives a court any authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be maintained as a class action." (13) This language in Eisen "quickly came to stand for a general rule prohibiting any preliminary investigation of the merits at the certification stage," (14) despite the Court's seemingly contradictory directive in Falcon. (15)

B. Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes

Members of both the plaintiffs' and defense bars recognized that Dukes would have a significant impact on employment related class action claims. Prior to the publication of the Court's decision in Dukes, plaintiffs' attorneys predicted that the court's decision would be a vindication of the use of the class action process to secure women's rights for equal treatment on the job. Defense counsel had high hopes that Dukes would rein in the rapid growth of class action claims. Dukes provided an important test case because the purported class consisted of more than a million Wal-Mart employees across 3,400 stores. The size of the class and factual differences raised serious questions about the commonality element required to establish a class.

The putative class in Dukes was represented by seven named female plaintiffs, each of whom alleged that members of Wal-Mart's management had discriminated against her. Their discrimination claims ranged from sexual harassment to failure to promote. (16) Each of the plaintiffs' claims varied to a greater or lesser degree. As a result, the putative class that may have been impacted by the claims of any one class representative were extraordinarily large. A class this size presented a significant threat to Wal-Mart, but the risks to the purported class in Dukes were equally high. If class representatives lost at trial, they could doom the hopes of absent class members with stronger, perhaps more valid claims. In this respect, the named plaintiffs faced the significant hurdle of demonstrating that they were typical of the class and shared common issues with all other class members, as required by Rule 23(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The District Court, which accepted plaintiffs' argument that the class shared commonality under Rule 23(b)(2), focused on two of the plaintiffs' commonality arguments in its ruling. First, all other things being equal, women were paid less than men in comparable positions. (17) Second, women received fewer promotions to management positions than men. (18) The court found that the plaintiffs presented evidence showing that each of these facts raised issues that were common. The statistical evidence plaintiffs presented demonstrated that there were common compensation and promotion policies affecting all women; a strong Wal-Mart corporate culture, which included gender stereotyping; and most importantly, a common feature of excessive subjectivity, which provided a conduit for gender bias that affected all members of a class in a similar fashion. (19)

Both a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit and later the Ninth Circuit sitting en banc affirmed the district court's certification order. (20) Like the district court, the panel found that the plaintiffs' corporate culture evidence provided a nexus between the subjective decision-making of Wal-Mart managers and the evidence of pay and promotion disparity. The en banc court also found that plaintiffs showed a common pattern of discrimination resulting from a uniform management structure, a strong centralized corporate culture, and gender disparity in every domestic region of Wal-Mart. (21) The Ninth Circuit also held that a Daubert inquiry at the class certification stage was premature, and therefore it would avoid resolving the battle of the experts by employing a lower Daubert standard at the class certification stage of the proceeding. (22)

With regard to Rule 23(b)(2), the Ninth Circuit concluded that the trial court retained the discretion to grant certification under Rule 23(b)(2). (23) The court was not persuaded by Wal-Mart's argument that certification would be improper because much of the putative class seeking injunctive relief could not in fact benefit from the injunction. (24) While the panel agreed with Wal-Mart that those individuals no longer employed by WalMart when the complaint was filed lacked standing, the court did not find that fact fatal to class certification. (25)

By the time the Dukes case had proceeded through the district court and the Ninth Circuit, the effective decisions in place were:

1. Under the right circumstances, plaintiff could certify a class for monetary damages under Rule 23(b)(2) even though the text of that subsection only provided for injunctive or declaratory relief;

2. Plaintiffs could satisfy Rule 23(a)(2) commonality requirements by alleging that a corporate culture or collective managerial decisions resulted in pervasive discrimination;

3. A full Daubert inquiry was not necessary at the certification stage or, in the alternative, a challenge to whether an expert's conclusion properly arose from his method was not itself a Daubert challenge; and,

4. Trial-by-statistics did not violate due process, even if it precluded defenses that due process would require in an individual trial on the same subject.

C. The Supreme Court's Decision

The Supreme Court held in a unanimous decision that Rule 23(b)(2) could not be used to certify a class seeking primarily money damages. (26) It also held in a 5 to 4 decision that the commonality requirement mandated that plaintiffs identify an issue whose resolution would be common to the entire class. (27) In reaching this holding, the Court also provided guidance on the extent to which a trial court could inquire into the merits of the class action at the certification stage and the degree to which the trial court could rely on statistics as class-wide proof of common issues.

The Court unanimously held that the plaintiff could not use Rule 23(b)(2) as an alternative means of certifying a class that sought monetary damages. While the Court did not claim to address the broader question of whether Rule 23(b)(2) extended beyond the injunctive and declaratory relief, its holding limited the kind of relief plaintiffs can seek under this section. The Court's primary concern was that Rule 23(b)(2) does not allow class members to opt-out of the litigation. (28) Class-wide declaratory injunctive relief is indivisible and applies to all class members equally, or not at all. (29) The Court noted that the structure of Rule 23(b)(3) provided the best mechanism for certifying a class for monetary damages because of the protections it provides, (30) and because the opt-out provisions of Rule 23(b)(3) protect the due process rights of class members who do not want to forfeit their individual claim. (31)

On the issue whether the various parts of Rule 23(a) had been fulfilled in the certification of the class, (32) the Court primarily focused on plaintiffs' theory of commonality. The Court held that the common element necessary to sustain a finding of commonality must depend upon a common contention. (33) If, for example, the plaintiffs had all shared the same supervisor, they could argue that the common evidence of his particular management practices would apply to all of them. What was important to the Court was that the "common issue" be capable of class-wide resolution, which means that the determination of its truth or falsity will resolve the issue that is central to each plaintiff in one stroke. (34)

The Court also squarely addressed whether a trial court could engage in merit inquiry when deciding class certification. The Court attributed the continued confusion over the propriety of these inquiries to the earlier statement made in Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, (35) that the Court found "nothing in either the language or history of Rule 23 that gives a court any authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be maintained as a class action." (36) However, in Eisen, as the Dukes Court noted, "the judge had conducted a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit, not in order to determine the propriety of certification under Rules 23(a) and (b) ... but in order to shift the cost of notice required by Rule 23(c)(2) from the plaintiff to the defendants" (37) The Court dismissed any further application of that narrow holding as the "purest dictum" and settled the question that the trial court may inquire into the merits of a claim in deciding certification. (38)

Finally, the Court held that the statistical methods used by the plaintiffs to avoid potential manageability and due process concerns (dubbed "trial by formula" by Justice Scalia) violates the Rules Enabling Act. (39) Since the proposed "trial by formula" would not allow Wal-Mart to assert valid defenses, permitting such a practice would limit Wal-Mart's substantive due process rights and was appropriately rejected by the Court.

III. The Legacy of Dukes

Dukes significantly altered the landscape of class action litigation, and particularly the landscape of employment cases. The Court made clear that plaintiffs must affirmatively demonstrate compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing class actions, specifically Rule 23. In the wake of Dukes, employers have enjoyed increased success in defeating nationwide class certifications, but are now faced with multiple, regional mini-classes brought by employees using a strategy that has been called "death by a thousand cuts." (40) This section outlines the progreny of Dukes, as well as the new strategies that plaintiffs have introduced to avoid the Dukes holding.

A. Comcast Corp. v. Behrend (41)

In Dukes, the Court reconfirmed its ruling in Falcon that courts considering Rule 23(a) class certifications must complete a rigorous analysis that sometimes "necessarily overlaps" with the merits. (42) What remained unclear after Dukes, however, was whether the same rigorous analysis standard applied to (i) the resolution of questions of predominance under Rule 23(b), specifically Rule 23(b)(3), in addition to the question of commonality under Rule 23(a); (ii) claims arising outside the employment context; and (iii) the determination of whether class representatives can prove the amount of damages with class-wide proof. As set forth below, in 2013 in Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision answered each of these questions in the affirmative. (43)

In Comcast, the Supreme Court reversed certification of a class of Comcast subscribers. The Court held that the plaintiffs had not met the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) because they had not adequately demonstrated that damages were "susceptible of measurement across the entire class for Rule 23(b)(3) purposes." (44) Specifically, the Court ruled that class certification is not proper when "damage calculations will inevitably overwhelm questions common to the class." (45)

In Comcast, the plaintiffs, who were subscribers to Comcast's cable television programming services, alleged that the defendant violated antitrust laws by using an anticompetitive "clustering strategy" in which it concentrated its operations in certain markets, thereby eliminating competition and driving up prices for programming. Plaintiffs sought class certification under Rule 23(b)(3), which requires for certification that "questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members."

Before the district court, the plaintiffs advanced four theories of antitrust impact. The court accepted only one of those theories as susceptible to proof on a class-wide basis. Pursuant to that theory, Comcast's alleged clustering strategy deterred competition from companies that provided alternative telecommunications capabilities using infrastructure already in place. These companies are called "overbuilders." The district court permitted plaintiffs to seek to prove antitrust injury based solely on this "overbuilders" theory.

To show that damages could be measured on a class-wide basis, the plaintiffs relied on a statistical regression model that measured the effect of the four antitrust impacts on cable prices. The expert who designed the regression model acknowledged that it did not isolate damages resulting only from the overbuilder theory but instead included damages attributable to all four theories of antitrust impact, three of which the court had rejected. Accordingly, the defendant argued that the the class should not be certified, in part, because the plaintiffs failed to prove that damages resulting from overbuilder deterrence could be calculated on a class-wide basis.

The district court declined to consider the defendant's argument and certified the class. (46) A divided Third Circuit affirmed, holding that " [a]t the class certification stage we do not require that Plaintiffs tie each theory of antitrust impact to an exact calculation of damages." (47) Instead, all that is necessary is that plaintiffs "assure us that if they can prove antitrust impact, the resulting damages are capable of measurement and will not require labyrinthine individual calculations." (48)

The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the rigorous analysis standard set forth in Falcon and reiterated in Dukes applies with equal force to class certification of antitrust claims under Rule 23(b) such that the district court was required to assess whether the expert's damages methodology could apply class-wide. (49) Quoting both Falcon and Dukes, Justice Scalia, writing for the majority noted that "[b]y refusing to entertain arguments against respondents' damages model that bore on the propriety of class certification, simply because those arguments would also be pertinent to the merits determination, the Court of Appeals ran afoul of our precedents requiring precisely that inquiry." (50) The Court stated that the plaintiffs fell "far short of establishing that damages are capable of measurement on a classwide basis" (51) because plaintiffs statistical model "failed to measure damages resulting from the particular antitrust injury on which petitioners' liability in this action is premised." (52) As such, the damages model could not establish the predominance of a common damages question rendering certification of the class was improper. The Court explained that "at the class certification stage (as at trial) any model supporting a 'plaintiff's damages case must be consistent with its liability case, particularly with respect to the alleged anticompetitive effect of the violation.'" (53) To hold otherwise, would be to be to hold that "at the class-certification stage any method of measurement is acceptable so long as it can be applied class-wide, no matter how arbitrary the measurements may be. Such a proposition would reduce Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement to a nullity." (54)

Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, writing for the dissent, attempted to limit the impact of the majority decision, stating that "the decision should not be read to require, as a prerequisite to certification, that damages attributable to a classwide injury be measurable on a class-wide basis," and that the ruling was good "for this day and case only." (55) The dissent also criticized the majority for "consider[ing] fact-based matters." (56) According to the dissent, the predominance requirement "scarcely demands commonality as to all questions" and that "when adjudication of questions of liability common to the class will achieve economies of time and expense, the predominance standard is generally satisfied even if damages are not provable in the aggregate." (57)

One interesting aspect of the Comcast decision is that it did not reach the issue of whether a district court must conduct a Daubert evidentiary analysis when considering a motion to certify a class. This omission from the Court's decision was surprising given the fact that, in granting certiorari, the Supreme Court sought review of "Whether a district court may certify a class action without resolving whether the plaintiff class has introduced admissible evidence, including expert testimony, to show the case is susceptible to awarding damages on class-wide basis." (58) Based on that question, the parties focused much of their briefing and oral argument on issues related to admissibility of the plaintiffs' expert report and application of Daubert in class certification cases. (59) While some commentators feel that the Court dodged the issue, it explained that it could not decide that question because the defendant did not object to the admissibility of the plaintiffs' expert's testimony and thereby failed to preserve the issue for appellate review. (60)

Comcast is significant because it lays to rest any argument that Falcons requirement and Dukes endorsement of the "rigorous analysis" standard is limited to certification under Rule 23(a) or Title VII claims. While it remains to be seen exactly what the impact of Comcast will be on class certification, what does seem clear is that, in antitrust and non-antitrust cases, all Rule 23 elements, including damages, require "rigorous analysis" regardless of whether the certification inquiry overlaps with the merits. Just over one year after the decision was announced, it appears as though class certification decisions have fallen into one of the following three groups: (1) decisions applying Comcast and denying class certification because Rule 23(b)(3) was not satisfied; (2) decisions applying Comcast and denying class certification because Rule 23(b)(3) was not satisfied; and (3) decisions taking a middle approach by employing Rule 23(c)(4) and maintaining class certification as to liability only, leaving damages for a separate, individualized determination. (61) Set forth below is a discussion of how various circuits have dealt with Comcast and a few of the cases worth watching.

B. The Comcast Effect

In the immediate wake of Comcast many commentators predicted that the Court's decision would be a new arrow in defense counsels' quivers. To be certain, the Court did, for the first time, explicitly confirm that the "rigorous analysis" standard required by Falcon and Dukes in the Rule 23(a) context extends to Rule 23(b)(3). That said, many of the circuits that have had the opportunity to address Comcast in considering Rule 23(b)(3) certifications have, at the least, dulled the arrow a bit.

I. Fifth Circuit

One area of confusion left by the Comcast Court is whether an analysis of the damages theory is always required at the class certification stage. The Fifth Circuit recently answered this question in the negative in upholding class in In re Deepwater Horizon. In that case, the plaintiffs alleged damages resulted from the BP PLC oil spill. In upholding certification despite the lack of a formula for determining class-wide damages, the court, relying in part on the Comcast dissent, ruled that submission of a formula for class-wide measurement of damages is not a prerequisite to certification under Rule 23(b)(3). (62) Specifically, the court said that, "nothing in Comcast mandates a formula for classwide measurement of damages in all cases. Even after Comcast, therefore, this holding has no impact on cases such as the present one, in which predominance was based not on common issues of damages but on the numerous common issues of liability." (63)

2. Sixth and Seventh Circuits

In both the Sixth Circuit case of In re Whirlpool Corp. Front-Loading Washer Products Liability Litigation (64) and the Seventh Circuit case of Butler v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., (65) the plaintiffs alleged that washing machines had a design defect and or manufacturing defect. In both cases, the alleged issues arising from the alleged defects manifested for only a very small percentage of purchasers. Despite these facts, the Whirlpool court affirmed certification of a class of all Ohio residents who purchased twenty-one different washing machine models, (66) and the Sears court affirmed certification for a class of buyers of twenty-seven different models in six different States, the relevant laws of which vary. (67) The defendant in each case appealed to the Supreme Court. In both cases, the Court granted the petitions, vacated the holdings and remanded for consideration in light of Comcast. (68)

On remand, the Sixth and Seventh Circuits both upheld the class certifications and relied on similar reasoning in so doing. In both cases, the courts distinguished Comcast as a suit where plaintiffs sought to certify both liability and damages. (69) In the Sixth Circuit the Whirlpool court concluded that Comcast did not alter the outcome of its prior decision regarding a liability-only class, because '"no matter how individualized the issue of damages may be,' the determination of damages 'may be reserved for individual treatment with the question of liability tried as a class action.'" (70) Similarly, in Sears, the Seventh Circuit was working with a liability-only class when it reaffirmed certification on the grounds that damages experienced by individual class members could be determined following a liability ruling as permitted by Rule 23(c)(4). (71) Judge Posner, writing for court stated that, "[i]t would drive a stake through the heart of the class action device, in cases in which damages were sought rather than an injunction or a declaratory judgment to require that every member of the class have identical damages." (72)

In July 2014, the Seventh Circuit continued applying a narrow interpretation of Comcast when it vacated the district court's denial of class certification in In re IKO Roofing Shingle Products Liability Litigation. (73)

The plaintiffs in IKO were purchasers of organic asphalt roofing shingles who allege that the defendant falsely represented that the shingles met an industry standard known as ASTM D225. Plaintiffs asked the district court to certify a class that would cover IKO's sales in eight states since 1979 and the district court declined to do so. In making its ruling, the district court relied in part on Comcast in requiring proof that plaintiffs "will experience a common damage" and that their claimed damages "are not disparate." (74) Because there would be inevitable differences in the individual plaintiffs' experiences with the defendant, the district court denied to certify the class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3). (75)

In vacating the district court's ruling, a Seventh Circuit panel disagreed with the district court's reading of Dukes and Comcast as requiring plaintiff to demonstrate "commonality of damages." The Seventh Circuit, in delivering its most narrow reading of the Supreme Court's decisions yet, held that these cases require only that class plaintiffs, like any other plaintiff, match their theory of loss to their theory of liability. (76) The court then distinguished the present case from Comcast noting that the plaintiffs had two "theories of damages that match[ed] their theory of liability." (77) It noted that following the district court's interpretation of Dukes and Comcast would render consumer products class actions "impossible" and its previous holding in Sears incorrect. (78)

Although each of these cases arose outside the employment context, it is clear that each one frustrates an employer's ability to argue disparate damages as a basis for denying class certification.

3. Ninth Circuit

Another question left unanswered by the Court in Comcast is whether individualized damages determinations alone are sufficient to defeat class certification. The Ninth Circuit was confronted with this question in Leyva v. Medline Industries, (79) In Leyva, a state law wage and hour case, the court held that Comcast did not preclude class certification, despite the fact that each class member's damages were different, because evidence suggested that the employer could "efficiently" calculate damages using information in a computer database. (80) Therefore, even though highly individualized and fact-specific, there was a workable class-wide damages theory. (81) In reaching its decision the court recognized that "damages determinations are individual in nearly all wage-and-hour class actions," (82) and "[i]n this circuit ... damage calculations alone cannot defeat class certification." (83)

The court, citing Leyva, reiterated its position in the more recent case of Jimenez v. Allstate Ins. Co. (84) In Jimenez, the lead plaintiff and about 800 other Allstate employees in California alleged that Allstate has a practice or unofficial policy of requiring its claims adjusters to work unpaid off-the-clock overtime in violation of California law. (85) The court affirmed the lower courts certification of the class finding that the plaintiffs had established that common questions existed pursuant to Rule 23(a)(2) and that those common questions predominated pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3). (86) The common questions were:



 (i) whether class members generally
 worked overtime without receiving compensation
 as a result of Defendant's
 unofficial policy of discouraging reporting
 of such overtime, Defendant's failure
 to reduce class members' workload after
 the reclassification, and Defendant's
 policy of treating their pay as salaries
 for which overtime was an "exception";
 (ii) whether Defendant knew or should
 have known that class members did so;
 and (iii) whether Defendant stood idly
 by without compensating class members
 for such overtime. (87)


Additionally, the common question of "whether Allstate had an 'unofficial policy' of denying overtime payments while requiring overtime work predominated over any individualized issues regarding the specific amount of damages a particular class member may be able to prove." (88) In concluding that class treatment was, therefore, a superior method adjudication, the court noted that, contrary to Allstate's position that it was entitled to individualized determination of each employee's eligibility for back pay, "statistical sampling of class members could accurately and efficiently resolve the question of liability, while leaving the potentially difficult issue of individualized damage assessments for a later day." (89)

On February 27, 2015, Allstate filed a petition for writ of certiorari asking first, "Whether the court of appeals erred in holding, in conflict with decisions of the Second, Fifth, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits, that the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 are satisfied by purportedly 'common' questions that do not resolve the defendant's liability as to any individual class member and would require hundreds of separate follow-up trials," and, second, "Whether the court of appeals erred in holding that Rule 23 and the Due Process Clause permit class-wide resolution of a defendant's liability through a class process that prevents the defendant from raising individualized defenses in the liability phase." (90)

For now, it appears as though in the Ninth Circuit individualized damages alone is not enough to defeat class certification.

4. Second Circuit

While the early circuit court cases applying Comcast in the Rule 23(b)(3) context may be seen as a blow to the high hopes that many defense attorneys had when the decision was first published, there is a very recent decision from the Second Circuit that is encouraging for employers.

In Johnson v. Nextel Communications, a group of clients brought putative class action claims of breach of fiduciary duty, legal malpractice, and breach of contract in state court against the law firm that had represented the clients in employment discrimination litigation against their employer and asserted claims against their employer, challenging an agreement that set up a dispute resolution process to resolve the clients' claims without litigation. (91) In vacating the district court's certification of the class, the panel found that, despite the fact that the employer's role in negotiating and approving a dispute resolution agreement would be same for every class members' claim, where each member of a potential subclass of clients would require a case-by-case inquiry into whether the subclass members waived conflict of interest protections, the interpretation of each client's retainer agreement would be governed by law of each client's home state, and each client's damages would have to be calculated individually, common issues did not predominate. (92) Therefore, "[b]ecause liability for a significant bloc of the class members and damages for the entire class must be decided on an individual basis, common issues do not predominate over individual ones and a class action is not a superior method of litigating the case." (93)

Moreover, there are several interesting employment-related cases pending the Second Circuit that are worth closely watching. In the first case, Roach v. T.L. Cannon Corp., the district court denied certification of a wage-and-hour class under Rule 23(b)(3) when the plaintiffs failed to offer a class-wide damages model, rejecting the argument that damages need not be considered at the certification stage. (94) The plaintiffs in Roach were employees at Applebee's restaurants who were not paid wages to which they were entitled under state and federal law. In seeking to bring a class action, the plaintiffs presented evidence of the defendants' uniform policies and practices that led to the wage law violations. Nonetheless, in stark contrast to the Ninth Circuit's holding in Leyva, the district court denied class certification, citing Comcast for the proposition that a class action cannot be maintained whenever monetary relief must be calculated on an individual basis for each member of the class. (95)

In Jacob v. Duane Reade, (96) the plaintiffs, assistant store managers, allege that the defendant failed to compensate them for hours worked in excess of forty hours per week in violation of the FLSA and New York Labor Law ("NYLL"). Prior to the Comcast decision, the district court certified a class with respect to the NYLL claims--a ruling for which the defendant sought reconsideration following Comcast. In support of its motion for reconsideration the defendant argued that damage calculations for each of the 750 class members would be "inherently individualized" and plaintiffs offered no model to measure damages on a class-wide basis. (97) The district court, like the Sixth and Seventh Circuit courts in the washing machine cases, opted to affirm certification with respect to liability, while "partially decertify[ing]" the class by requiring plaintiffs to proceed individually on their damages claims pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4) if liability is found. (98)

The Second Circuit agreed to hear the appeal of these cases in tandem. The court's holding will likely have a significant impact wage and hour cases throughout the country since those cases often involve the calculation of highly-individualized damages for each class member. Employers and employees should watch these cases closely to how the Second Circuit treats the existence of individualized damages in this post- Comcast era.

On July 1, 2014, in Houser v. Pritzker, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York certified a liability class under Rule 23(a) in a Title VII suit brought against the United States Census Bureau while declining to certify the plaintiffs' proposed damages subclasses under Rule 23(b)(3) based on Comcast. (99) Applying Comcast, the court concluded that the plaintiffs' proposed damages model was over-inclusive and "inevitably" included individuals not entitled to back pay because they would not have been hired absent the alleged discrimination. (100) Because Title VII affords defendants the right to rebut a presumptive entitlement to back pay with fact-specific, individualized defenses, questions of individualized entitlement to damages would "overwhelm" the litigation. (101) However, as the court did in Jacob, rather than reject certification entirely, the court, at the plaintiffs' urging, exercised its discretion under Rule 23(c)(4) to bifurcate the liability and damages phase, and proceed to adjudication of the liability questions. (102)

One clear post-Dukes trend has emerged in the circuit courts. A review of various circuit court cases applying Dukes indicates that absent a company-wide policy or practice common across the class --or, put differently, where local managers exercise discretion or control--certification will be difficult for employees. (103) Conversely, where a company-wide policy or practice common to all class members gives rise to the alleged injury or injuries, some post-Dukes certifications have been affirmed. (104)

III. The Impact of Dukes on Employment-related Class Actions

Following Dukes, the Court has rendered several other opinions that significantly impact employment-related class action litigation, all of which employers can laud as victories. Since the pro-defendant/employer Dukes decision, the Court seems to be continuing its trend toward evening the playing field for defendant/employers by (1) enforcing class action waivers in arbitration agreements, (2) reigning in plaintiffs' "forum shopping" in class action litigation, and (3) providing defendants greater access to federal courts. The impact of these post-Dukes opinions is analyzed in this section.

A. American Express v. Italian Colors Restaurant

I. The Holding

One of the most significant opinions that the Court issued was in American Express v. Italian Colors Restaurant, (105) in

488 (7th Cir. 2012) (reversing the denial of certification of a class of 700 African American brokers claiming racial discrimination on the basis of two company-wide policies, noting that certification would be improper if local managers had been permitted to exercise their own discretion implementing the policies) While these cases may seem to discourage employers from implementing any single overarching company-wide policy, such as one prohibiting discrimination and requiring compliance with the law generally, such policies will generally not support certification. See Bolden, 688 F.3d at 898 (reversing certification where the company had no relevant company-wide policy, aside from "its rule against racial discrimination."). which the Court enhanced the ability of employers to contract out of potential class action litigation. The issue in American Express was "whether a contractual waiver of class arbitration is enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") when the plaintiff's cost of individually arbitrating a federal statutory claim exceeds the potential recovery." (106) In a 5-3 decision, the Court held that the class action waiver in the parties' contract was enforceable, even though the provision made it economically unfeasible to prosecute the antitrust claim. In other words, plaintiffs cannot use the "effective vindication" doctrine to invalidate class action waiver provisions in circumstances where the recovery sought is exceeded by the costs of individual arbitration. (107)

The plaintiffs in American Express were merchants and business owners who accepted payments from customers through American Express credit cards and entered into standardized agreements with American Express regarding the terms of participation in their payment system. In each of these agreements, there was a provision requiring that the parties arbitrate any disputes that arose out of the agreement. The provision also contained a waiver of the right for multiple merchants or business owners to pursue class arbitration against American Express. The effect of the provision was that each individual claim had to be arbitrated independently, even if the amount in controversy was small.

Normally, when a group of individuals are aggrieved by a single entity, but only a small amount of damages result, they can unite and bring a single lawsuit so that the legal fees and costs associated with the case will not engulf the anticipated recovery. This argument was integral to the plaintiff s case in American Express. The holding in American Express (coupled with the holding in Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. Animal-Feeds Int'l Corp. (108)) frustrates such an effort when individuals enter into arbitration agreements that do not expressly allow arbitration of class claims.

2. Exceptions To The Enforcement Of Arbitration Agreements

The Supreme Court has instructed lower courts to "'rigorously enforce' arbitration agreements according to their terms," (109) but acknowledged the following two exceptions to this directive: (1) where the FAA's mandate is "overridden by a contrary congressional command" and (2) where the parties' agreement includes a prospective waiver of a federal statutory right, the court-crafted "effective vindication" exception to the FAA. The Court in American Express found that the first exception did not apply because there was no contrary congressional command in the federal antitrust laws. (110)

The Court then analyzed the "effective vindication" exception and determined that it did not apply to the facts of the case. The "effective vindication" exception to the FAA originated as dictum in the Court's decision in Mitsubishi Motors v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, (11) where the Court expressed a willingness to invalidate, on public policy grounds, arbitration agreements that operate as a prospective waiver of a party's right to pursue statutory remedies. In American Express, the plaintiffs argued that the Court should invalidate the arbitration agreement because its terms effectively foreclosed vindication of their federal (antitrust) rights. Plaintiffs argued that they could not pursue their antitrust claims because the experts required to prove the claim would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, while the individual recovery would not exceed $40,000. (112) The Court rejected that argument and held that "the fact that it is not worth the expense involved in proving a statutory remedy does not constitute the elimination of the right to pursue that remedy." (113)

American Express and its progeny pave the way for employers to incorporate class action waiver provisions in their employment agreements. However, employers should be mindful that these waivers should typically be incorporated in arbitration clauses within employment agreements. Otherwise, the holding in American Express would not benefit employers. American Express does not address the validity of class or collective action waivers outside of the arbitration context. And, the federal policy in the FAA would not be implicated or serve to outweigh the policy set forth in federal statutes, like the FLSA. (114)

3. The Impact of American Express

The opinion in American Express has already impeded class actions in favor of arbitrations in several federal courts, despite some of the courts' express discontent with enforcing the arbitration provisions. (115) The opinion also reversed the related, but even more troubling and encompassing trend where courts were requiring that, if any potential class member met the burden of proving that his costs precluded him from effectively vindicating his statutory rights in arbitration, the clause was unenforceable as to the class or collective. (116)

Post-American Express decisions do not uniformly enforce arbitration agreements with class action waivers. The Supreme Court explicitly noted in American Express that the result might be different if an arbitration provision required a plaintiff to pay "filing and administrative fees attached to arbitration that are so high as to make access to the forum impracticable." (117) In Chavarria v. Ralph's Grocery, (118) the Ninth Circuit seized on this language to strike an arbitration provision as unconscionable that split the costs of arbitration equally between the parties before the arbitration commenced. The plaintiff was required to pay half of the non-refundable arbitration costs irrespective of the outcome of the arbitration. The court found that the administrative and filing costs imposed by the arbitration provision effectively foreclosed the plaintiffs pursuit of the claim and was thus substantively unconscionable. (119) In Kilgore v. Key Bank National Association, (120) however, the Ninth Circuit rejected the plaintiffs' argument that there were some putative class members who may not be able to afford the arbitration fees because, the court held, the mere risk that a plaintiff will face prohibitive costs is too speculative to justify invalidating an arbitration agreement. (121)

In Reed Elsevier, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled differently from the Ninth Circuit in a matter that contained similar facts as those in Chavarria. In Reed Elsevier, the plaintiff argued that the arbitration clause prohibiting class-wide arbitration was economically unfeasible and thus unconscionable because it required the plaintiff to pay his own legal fees, even if the arbitrator concluded that the defendant violated the law, and it required the plaintiff to split the costs for the arbitrator's fee. (122) Pursuant to the holding in American Express, the court suppressed its serious concerns about the fairness of the arbitration agreement and enforced it. (123) Notably, the court also noted that the plaintiff could have avoided the arguably unconscionable arbitration provision by contracting with another company to provide legal research services, other than the defendant, that did not have a similar arbitration clause. (124) Unlike the Sixth Circuit in Reed Elsevier, the Ninth Circuit did not mention such a "marketplace" solution to an arguably oppressive arbitration clause before it deemed the clause unenforceable in Chavarria.

Other cases decided since American Express serve as cautionary tales for employers to carefully draft arbitration agreements so that there can be no argument not to enforce them. The Southern District of New York decided two cases in which the arbitration agreements included a provision that only claims or controversies required to be arbitrated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") rules would be resolved by individual (not class or collective) arbitration. (125) The court noted that American Express did not "touch on whether arbitration should be compelled. ... where FINRA rules bind the parties" and found that the FINRA rules prohibit the enforcement of arbitration agreements against members of a putative class or collective action until class or collective certification has been denied or decertified. (126) 127

B. Standard Fire Insurance Co. v. Knowles

I. The Holding

In 2013, the Supreme Court also decided Standard Fire Insurance Co. v. Knowles, (127) which rejected plaintiffs' frequently used attempts to forum-shop their class action lawsuits. The issue in Standard Fire was whether a named plaintiff in a class action can avoid federal jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act ("CAFA") by stipulating, before the class is certified, that he will not seek more than $5 million in damages. In a rare unanimous decision, the Court held that a named plaintiffs stipulation not to seek damages in excess of the $5 million jurisdictional threshold does not bind the class and therefore does not preclude federal jurisdiction. (128) The Court declared that--"A plaintiff who files a proposed class action cannot legally bind members of the proposed class before the class is certified." (129) The reason for the Court's decision is that, prior to class certification, the named plaintiff does not represent the class. A named plaintiffs stipulation can only bind him as to his own damages, but he does not have the power to bind anyone else in the class as to their damages. As a result, such a stipulation does not limit the amount of potential damages that the class would be able to recover and so does not affect removability under CARA. (130)

While the Standard Fire opinion prohibits named plaintiffs from binding putative class members on a limitation of damages, a named plaintiff can still bind absent class members to decisions that govern the litigation proceedings. For instance, in Day v. Persels & Assocs., (131) the Eleventh Circuit held that Standard Fire does not strip a named plaintiff s authority to bind absent class members when the named plaintiff consents to the jurisdiction of the magistrate judge before the class has been certified. (132)

2. Plaintiffs can Still Avoid CAFA Jurisdiction

Although the Supreme Court appeared to display little patience with efforts by the plaintiffs' bar to evade CAFA's removal provisions, Standard Fire should not be read to promulgate a broad rule that CAFA does not allow plaintiffs to structure their lawsuits to avoid CAFA jurisdiction. Since the Court's opinion in Standard Fire was handed down, crafty plaintiffs have been able to circumvent CAFA's "mass action" provision, which permits defendants to remove cases from state to federal court if there are more than 100 plaintiffs and certain other conditions are met. For instance, in Scimone v. Carnival Corp. (133) the Eleventh Circuit held that the plaintiffs were able to successfully avoid CAFA jurisdiction by filing almost identical separate complaints, each naming less than 100 plaintiffs, and by not moving for or otherwise proposing joint trial in the state court. The Ninth Circuit reached the same decision in Romo v. Teva Pharmaceuticals. (154)

3. Named Plaintiffs have a Fiduciary Duty to Putative Class Members

The Court's opinion in Standard Fire focused on a named plaintiffs fiduciary duty to the putative class that he aspires to represent. The Court recognized that a named plaintiffs fiduciary duty prohibits him from throwing away what could be a major component of the class's recovery. (135) Since this opinion, lower courts have expounded upon a named plaintiffs fiduciary duty and further explained when the named plaintiff can bind the class or collective. In Gawarecki v. A TM Network, a district court in Minnesota cited Standard Fire to support its holding that the plaintiffs could not abandon the actual damages claims of the putative class members, prior to class certification, in an effort to avoid federal jurisdiction. (136) Likewise, in Addison Automatics, v. Hartford Casualty Insurance, (137) the Seventh Circuit held that a class representative's fiduciary duty to class members carriers over to separate litigation affecting the class. (138) The court joined the Eighth Circuit and held that where representatives of a class in a federal case under federal law pursued individual relief in a separate but parallel action in state court under state law, the class representative still owed fiduciary duties to the members of the federal class when pursuing the state court action. (139)

C. Genesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk

I. The Holding

The circuit courts are split on whether an unaccepted offer of judgment that fully satisfies a plaintiffs claim is sufficient to render the claim moot and thus beyond the judicial power of Article III of the United States Constitution. While the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Genesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk (140) seemingly to resolve this split, the Court ultimately decided the case on narrower grounds and did not reach the question or resolve the split because the plaintiff conceded that the offer of judgment mooted her individual claim and did not raise the issue on appeal. (141)

Genesis Healthcare was a putative collective action in which the plaintiff alleged that Genesis violated the Fair Labor Standards Act. Before any other plaintiffs joined the action, Genesis made an offer of judgment for full relief of the plaintiffs claims. The plaintiff did not accept the offer, but the district court dismissed the case because the offer of judgment left the plaintiff without a personal stake in the litigation. Although the plaintiff conceded that the offer of judgment mooted her individual claim, she argued that Genesis was simply trying to "pick off" her claim by satisfying it so that Genesis could avoid facing the collective action suit on behalf of the other employees. The district court found that, because no other employees had joined the collective action and because the plaintiff had been offered full relief, her claim was moot. The Supreme Court agreed with the district court. However, courts have limited the analysis in Genesis to collective actions and concluded that the Genesis discussion does not apply to class actions. (142)

Because the Supreme Court did not reach this issue, the circuits remain divided on two issues--(1) whether an offer of judgment for the full amount of damages moots a plaintiffs individual claims, and (2) whether an offer of judgment before class certification or before individuals join a collective action effectively "picks off" a putative class representative.

2. Circuit Court Split

The circuits are split on whether an unaccepted Rule 68 offer moots the plaintiff's case. The majority of circuits have held that an offer of complete relief moots a plaintiffs individual claim. The

Third Circuit has held that "[a]n offer of complete relief will generally moot the plaintiffs claim, as at that point the plaintiff retains no personal interest in the outcome of the litigation." (143) The Fourth and Tenth Circuits have adopted this same approach. (144) The Seventh Circuit takes a more extreme approach and holds that "[o]nce the defendant offers to satisfy the plaintiff s entire demand, there is no dispute over which to litigate, and a plaintiff who refuses to acknowledge this loses outright, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), because he has no remaining stake." (145) The Sixth Circuit agrees with the Seventh Circuit that "an offer of judgment that satisfies a plaintiffs entire demand moots the case," but disagrees with the Seventh Circuit's view that a plaintiff loses outright when he refuses an offer of judgment that would satisfy his entire demand. Instead, the Sixth Circuit holds that "the better approach is to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in accordance with the defendants' Rule 68 offer of judgment." (146) Four justices dissented in Genesis Healthcare and sharply criticized the mootness-by-unaccepted-offer approach. (147)

The Second Circuit follows the Sixth Circuit's approach that when an unaccepted offer has been made, the better approach is to enter judgment against the defendant. (148) The Second Circuit addressed this issue in the context of an offer of settlement, as opposed to an offer of judgment, and held that an unaccepted offer of settlement for the full amount of damages owed does not moot a case such that the case should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction if the plaintiff desires to continue the action. (149) Rather, the proper disposition in such a situation is for the district court to enter judgment against the defendant for the proffered amount and to direct payment to the plaintiff consistent with the offer. (150)

The Ninth, Eleventh, and Fifth Circuits are at complete odds with the other circuits that have decided this issue and have explicitly adopted the position set out in the Genesis Healthcare dissent. The Ninth Circuit holds that "an unaccepted Rule 68 offer that would fully satisfy a plaintiff s claim is insufficient to render the claim moot." (151) Similarly, the Eleventh Circuit holds that "a plaintiff s individual claim is not mooted by an unaccepted Rule 68 offer of judgment." (152) The Fifth Circuit follows the same approach. (153)

3. The Offer of Judgment

While several circuits allow a defendant to moot a plaintiff s individual claim with an offer of judgment, the offer must be for the full amount of the plaintiffs requested relief. In several cases, defendants have made unsuccessful attempts at mooting a plaintiffs claim because the defendant did not offer the plaintiff everything the plaintiff demanded. (154) In this situation, the plaintiff still has a stake in the action because he may obtain additional relief if he prevails. (155) To hold otherwise would suggest that any reasonable offer of judgment moots a plaintiff s case or that long-shot claims are moot rather than unlikely to succeed. A plaintiff s prospects of success are not pertinent to the mootness inquiry. Courts have held that, even if a plaintiff demands more than he is entitled to under the law, the court cannot determine the merits of the plaintiffs' demand and, at the same time, dismiss the case on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction because of mootness. (156)

4. "Picking Off' a Putative Class Representative

The circuits remain split on whether a defendant can "pick off" a putative class representative by offering the full amount of his individual damages. The timing of class certification motions is critical to this debate. The Seventh Circuit holds that a defendant can render moot a possible class action by offering to settle for the full amount of the plaintiffs demands before the plaintiff files a motion for class certification. (157)

Most of the other circuits that have addressed this issue have reached a different result. In the Third, Fifth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits, a Rule 68 offer of full relief to the named plaintiff does not moot a class action, even if the offer precedes a class-certification motion, so long as the named plaintiff has not failed to diligently pursue class certification. (158) For instance, the Ninth Circuit holds that an unaccepted Rule 68 offer of judgment--for the full amount of the named plaintiffs individual claim and made before the named plaintiff files a motion for class certification--does not moot a class action. (159) If the named plaintiff can still file a timely motion for class certification, the named plaintiff may continue to represent the class until the district court decides the class certification issue. Then, if the district court certifies the class, certification relates back to the filing of the complaint. Once the class has been certified, the case may continue despite full satisfaction of the named plaintiffs individual claim because an offer of judgment to the named plaintiff fails to satisfy the demands of the class. (161) Conversely, if the district court denies class certification, the plaintiff may still pursue a limited appeal of the class certification decision. Only when the denial of class certification is final does the defendant's offer moot the case. (162)

D. Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Co. v. Owens

Another recent Supreme Court decision that hands a victory to employers is Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Co. v. Owens. (163) The holding in this case increases employer access to federal courts by clarifying that the burden of proof for removing cases to federal court on the grounds of diversity jurisdiction or the Class Action Fairness Act is a "preponderance of the evidence." The Court also supports the argument that a defendant employer's notice of removal need include only a plausible allegation that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional threshold; the notice need not contain evidentiary submissions unless the allegation is contested by the plaintiff or questioned by the Court. Now, it is clear that an employer's notice of removal need not meet a higher pleading standard than the one imposed on a plaintiff in drafting an initial complaint, which is merely "a short and plain statement." The Court explained that an employer's amount-in-controversy allegation seeking federal court jurisdiction should be accepted when not contested by the plaintiff or questioned by the court. If the plaintiff contests the employer's allegations, both sides must submit proof and the court will decide, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether the amount-in-controversy requirement has been satisfied. (164)

By embracing the "preponderance of the evidence" standard, the Court expressly rejected the burden of proof of "legal certainty" that some courts imposed on defendant employers seeking to establish the jurisdictional amount to obtain federal court jurisdiction. (165) The other nugget that the Court handed employers is its proclamation that there is no anti-removal presumption that attends cases invoking CAFA, which Congress enacted to facilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal court.

E. Brown v. Nucor Corporation (166)

A recent Fourth Circuit decision could signal post -Dukes commonality pendulum swinging back to center, with a focus on the Dukes commonality "glue."

In Nucor, African American steel workers brought a class action against employer under Â§ 1981 and Title VII alleging that they were subjected to discriminatory job promotion practices and a racially hostile work environment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1981. The plaintiffs based their promotions claim on allegations of a pattern or practice of racially disparate treatment in promotions decisions, and facially neutral promotions policies and procedures that had a racially disparate impact. The United States District Court for the District of South Carolina decertified promotions class in the wake of Dukes, and the commonality requirement set out in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(2). (167) Under that standard, the district court concluded that decertification of the promotions class was required because:

(1) the Court's examination of the workers' statistical analysis in the original certification decision was not sufficiently "rigorous" to assess whether it raised questions common to the class under Rule 23(a)(2);

(2) the workers' statistical and anecdotal evidence failed to establish such commonality because it did not provide "significant proof' that there existed both a "general policy of discrimination" and a "common injury";

(3) the delegation of subjective decision-making to Nucor supervisors was not, without more, a sufficiently uniform policy to present "'common' issues appropriate for resolution on a class-wide basis"; and

(4) even if the workers had identified a common question of law or fact satisfying Rule 23(a)(2), they failed to independently satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)'s requirements that common issues predominate and that the class action is a superior litigation device. The workers appealed, and the Circuit Court reversed decertification. In doing so, it held that the workers had advanced enough glue of commonality to support a post-Dukes certification. Noting the significant statistical and broad-sweeping anecdotal evidence of hostile environment and racial animus, the Court held:



 Here, for a liability determination in a
 disparate treatment claim, the workers'
 statistical and anecdotal evidence, especially
 when combined, thus provide
 precisely the 'glue' of commonality that
 Wal-Mart demands. Such a claim
 requires proof of a "systemwide pattern
 or practice" of discrimination such that
 the discrimination is "the regular
 rather than the unusual practice. The
 required discriminatory intent may be
 inferred upon such a showing. (168)


The Circuit Court also acknowledged significant differences from Dukes, including the class size. Whereas Wal-Mart's female workers consisted of millions of employees, working across thousands of stores, Nucor workers concerned approximately 100 putative class members in a single facility. In Dukes, the Supreme Court found it unlikely that thousands of managers across different regions would exercise their discretion in a common way without evidence of common direction. The Fourth Circuit found that here the workers provided evidence supporting their allegation of a common, racially-based exercise of discretion throughout the plant.

In a strongly worded dissent, Judge Agee noted that a plaintiff who brings a class-wide charge of discrimination must traverse a "wide gap" between his claim of individual mistreatment and a class-wide harm. The plaintiff could do so by offering "significant proof" that an employer "operated under a general policy of discrimination ... [that] manifested itself in hiring and promotion practices in the same general fashion." (169) Where the majority found that a discriminatory intent may be inferred from statistical showings, the dissent urged that the Court must scrutinize and test relevant statistical evidence at the certification stage and should not merely "defer to the plaintiff's expert. (170)

Nucor demonstrates that, particularly with manageable, single-site employment classes, the landscape of commonality glue, and how much evidence satisfies that necessary element, remains shifting.

IV. Conclusion

Only time will reveal the true impact of the Supreme Court's decisions affecting employment-related class action litigation, as the lower courts continue to digest and grapple with Dukes and its progeny. Most defendants would agree that over the past several years the Supreme Court has changed the landscape of class action litigation in an encouraging direction. The Court has reacted to plaintiffs' overreaching attempts to certify classes seeking primarily monetary damages under the less burdensome Rule 23(b)(2) standard, their attempts to "forum shop" class action lawsuits, their attempts to disregard class action waivers, and their attempts to deny defendants access to federal courts. In the meantime, the typical employment class action is becoming smaller, more focused, and generally striking only a single overarching policy or practice. Defendants can only hope that the Supreme Court's decisions over the next several years will be as enlightened as its Dukes and post-Dukes decisions in addressing these new, more tailored actions. But the employment class action is far from dead.

(130) The Court's opinion provided another small nugget for employers.

In 2005, Congress enacted CAFA as a piece of tort reform legislation. It was enacted against the backdrop of several state jurisdictions where a large proportion of class actions were filed and huge verdicts against corporate defendants were rendered. CAFA prevents this type of state court forum-shopping by granting jurisdiction to federal district courts over class actions involving more than 100 class members and more than $5 million in controversy, among other requirements. CAFA also provides that, when determining whether a matter exceeds the jurisdictional amount, the "claims of the individual class members must be aggregated." See 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1332(d)(6).

EEOC Sues Wal-Mart for Disability Discrimination And Harassment

Agency Says Retailer Denied Accommodations to and Harassed a Disabled Cancer Survivor

CHICAGO - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. violated federal law by failing to provide reasonable accommodations to an employee at its Hodgkins, Ill., store who was disabled by bone cancer and failing to stop harassment of the employee, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed yesterday.

According to Julianne Bowman, the EEOC's district director in Chicago, who managed EEOC's pre-suit administrative investigation, the Walmart store initially agreed to comply with employee Nancy Stack's request that the company provide a chair in her work area in the fitting room and limit her scheduled work hours because treatment for bone cancer in her leg limited her ability to walk and stand. After complying with her scheduling accommodation for many months, the store revoked it for no reason. And the store did not ensure that a chair was in Stack's work area, at one point telling her that she had to haul a chair from the furniture department every day, which was of course hard for her to do given her disability. Finally, the store transferred Stack from the fitting room to a greeter position, which did not comply with her restrictions on standing.

To add insult to injury, Bowman added, a co-worker harassed Stack by calling her names like "cripple" and "chemo brain," imitated her limp, and removed or hid the chair the employee needed in her work area. Stack complained repeatedly, but the store took no action to stop the co-worker's harassment.

Such alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, which can include denying reasonable accommodations to disabled employees and subjecting disabled employees to a hostile work environment.

The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. The case, EEOC v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Civil Action No. 15-5796, was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, and was assigned to U.S. District Judge Sharon Coleman. The government's litigation effort will be led by Trial Attorney Ann Henry and supervised by EEOC Supervisory Trial Attorney Diane Smason.

"It's hard to believe a retailer the size of Wal-Mart could not manage to consistently provide such a simple accommodation as a chair," said John Hendrickson, the regional attorney for EEOC's Chicago District Office. "Telling a disabled employee that she needs to drag a chair across the store every day is no accommodation at all. Employers have to provide reasonable accommodations unless doing so would be an undue hardship. EEOC is aware of no hardship that required Wal-Mart to suddenly change Stack's schedule, deny her the use of a chair, and transfer her out of the fitting room where she had performed her job well for years."

EEOC Trial Attorney Ann Henry commented, "No employee should have to go to work and face mocking and name calling because she had cancer. Employers who know about such vile harassment in their workplace have an obligation to stop it. Wal-Mart did not do that here, and the EEOC will seek to hold the company liable for that violation.

In July 2014, the EEOC filed a lawsuit against Wal-Mart alleging that it violated the ADA by firing an intellectually disabled employee at a Rockford Walmart store after it rescinded his workplace accommodation.

The EEOC's Chicago District Office is responsible for processing discrimination charges, administrative enforcement and the conduct of agency litigation in Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and North and South Dakota, with Area Offices in Milwaukee and Minneapolis.

The EEOC is responsible for enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its website at www.eeoc.gov.

CASE: Hannah v. Wal-Mart Stores

COURT: United States District Court

DOC. NO.: 3:14cv1808 • COURT OPINION BY: Hall, J.

DATE: June 17, 2015 • PAGES: 14

A court can exercise its discretion to consolidate discrimination complaints against a former employer, to conserve judicial resources. In 2010, defendant Wal-Mart announced it planned to eliminate "market-level" jobs in Connecticut, because of the economy. As a result of Wal-Mart's reorganization, two African-American employees, Michael Barham and Kim Hannah, were discharged. Barham and Hannah alleged that the reorganization was a fabricated so that Wal-Mart could eliminate certain African-American managers and that the African-American managers who were discharged were replaced by less qualified individuals who were not African-American. Barham and Hannah previously sued Wal-Mart, and their earlier suit remains undecided. Barham and Hannah re-applied to work at Wal-Mart and were not rehired. Barham alleged that Wal-Mart failed to hire him for eight jobs. Hannah alleged that Wal-Mart failed to hire her for three jobs. Barham and Hannah filed a second complaint against Wal-Mart and alleged that Wal-Martdiscriminated and retaliated, in violation of Title VII and the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act. Wal-Mart moved to dismiss and argued that their current claims are barred by the statute of limitations. A CFEPA complaint is considered "brought" on the date of service of the complaint on defendant. Plaintiffs received releases of jurisdiction on Sept. 8, 2014 and served Wal-Mart on Jan. 20, 2015. Plaintiffs did not provide legal authority to support their claims that as a result of the "relation back" doctrine, they were entitled to avoid the 90-day period in which to file suit, after the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities released its jurisdiction. The court granted Wal-Mart's motion to dismiss CFEPA claims, which were barred by the statute of limitations. The court found it would conserve judicial resources to decide all remaining claims in one court proceeding. Based on plaintiffs' representation that they will not request additional discovery, consolidation will not overly delay the resolution of the 2012 action. "[I]t would conserve the resources of both the court and the parties," wrote the court, "to try all of plaintiffs' claims in one proceeding." Plaintiffs' motion to consolidate granted.

The change happened essentially overnight. One minute, shoppers could load up on banners, placemats and T-shirts emblazoned with the battle flag of the slaveholding Confederacy. The next, the memorabilia was gone, pulled off shelves and out of online stores by the US's biggest retailers. "We never want to offend anyone with the products that we offer," said Walmart in a statement that was swiftly echoed by Amazon, eBay and Sears.

The move came in the wake of the murder of nine black churchgoers by a white man who advocated race war and was photographed posing next to the Civil War-era flag. The shooting in Charleston sparked calls for the flag - long associated with white resistance to black equality - to be removed from the South Carolina statehouse.

Spanish-language broadcaster Univision also took a stand on principle this week. It terminated its partnership with the Miss Universe beauty pageant after the event's co-owner, Donald Trump, disparaged Mexican immigrants while declaring his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination.

Big US businesses are weighing in on controversial social issues. This year, the chief executives of General Electric, Apple and Walmart all spoke out against "religious freedom" bills in Indiana and Arkansas that were widely seen as allowing discrimination against gays. Both states backed down.

Large technology groups including Microsoft and Facebook have also jumped into the US debate over rising inequality. Both companies now require their US suppliers to provide paid vacations and other benefits to their often low-paid employees.

So far, the bulk of the reaction to these corporate interventions has been positive. But there are dangers for companies if they get too far behind or ahead of majority opinion. Disney received no end of grief from conservative groups when it started hosting "Gay Days" at its theme parks and offering health benefits to employees' same-sex partners well before the US Supreme Court came down on the side of gay rights. The entertainment company stuck to its policies but it took years before majority opinion swung its way.

Many years later, in 2013, the Italian pasta company Barilla was hit with boycotts after chairman Guido Barilla said that the company would use only "classic" families in its advertising. Gay customers who disliked the idea, he added, could "eat another brand". Barilla has worked hard since then to improve its image, scoring 100 per cent on a recent survey of gay-friendly employment policies.

Similarly, Chick-fil-A, the fast-food group, came under criticism when its chief executive, Dan Cathy, spoke out against gay marriage. The company has historically been known for its Christian beliefs - it closes on Sundays - and religious conservatives backed Mr Cathy's stance.

But Mr Cathy later admitted that he had made a mistake. His personal beliefs have not changed but he said that he avoids public stances that could drive away patrons. "The wiser thing for us to do is to stay focused on customer service," he said last year.

As for Walmart, the Arkansas-based chain's critics point out that while it moved quickly against Confederate merchandise, it continues to sell guns.

That contrast is a good reminder that for-profit corporations are generally better at following public opinion than leading it.

Provost Umphrey Lawyer Brings Suit Against Wal-Mart for Age & Race    Discrimination

BEAUMONT, Texas, June 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Provost Umphrey attorney Jane Swearingen Leger, along with Jill Swearingen Pierce of Bradley, Steele & Pierce, LLP and Clay Dugas of Clay Dugas and Associates, filed suit against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. in Lake Charles, Louisiana on behalf of six plaintiffs alleging they were wrongfully terminated from Wal-Mart based on their age and race. Combined, the plaintiffs had over 100 years worth of work history with Wal-Mart stores.

The lawsuit comes just days after Wal-Mart decided to pull all items with the Confederate flag from their stores and online. While Wal-Mart decided to pull the products based on rising racial tensions, the plaintiffs are all black and over 40 years of age. According to the petition, the plaintiffs have exhausted all of the administrative remedies available to them. The plaintiffs have all filed a Charge of Discrimination with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as well as the Louisiana Workforce Commission.

Plaintiffs' claims involve the discriminatory practices of Wal-Mart through its store manager, Leah Loerwald. Clay Dugas has previously tried an employment discrimination case against Wal-Mart. In that case, the jury agreed that Wal-Mart unlawfully discriminated against a Texas employee based on the conduct of Mrs. Loerwald. Instead of terminating Mrs. Loerwald after the jury's finding of illegal discrimination, Wal-Mart simply transferred her to a store in Lake Charles, Louisiana where she continued her discriminatory practices.

"It's very telling of Wal-Mart's culture when a jury finds that a store manager illegally discriminated against a long-term employee, and the manager is not terminated or even disciplined. Instead, the manager was transferred to another store where she continued her illegal conduct," says Leger.

Leger is Board Certified in Personal Injury Trial Law and practices personal injury, maritime and employment law. She represents individuals who have been injured in industrial settings, vehicle collisions or suffered the results of discriminatory conduct. Her cases include clients in Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, California, Florida and Minnesota. Most recently Leger obtained a historic settlement for a client injured in a Georgia-Pacific boiler explosion accident in Georgia.

For more than forty years, Provost Umphrey's mission has remained to seek justice for those most in need -- those who have suffered a personal injury or death due to the wrongful conduct of others. Our attorneys fight for our clients nationwide with offices in Beaumont and Houston, Texas and Nashville, Tennessee. Led by Walter Umphrey, Provost Umphrey continues to be one of the most successful trial law firms in the nation by remaining Hard-Working Lawyers for Hard-Working People.

Battle over Confederate flag unfurls in S. Carolina and beyond

An initiative to remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State House grounds picked up steam on Tuesday, a week after the massacre of nine black church members, and criticism over the emblem long associated with slavery spread to other U.S. southern states.

U.S. retailers joined lawmakers in distancing themselves from the banner, with industry leaders Amazon.com Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc pulling the images of the rebel flag from their stores and websites, joining Google Inc , Sears Holdings Corp and eBay Inc .

The Civil War-era flag of the South's pro-slavery Confederacy has become a lightning rod for outrage over the shootings in Charleston, South Carolina, which authorities say was motivated by racial hatred.

In Columbia, the capital of South Carolina, hundreds of people chanted "Take it down," while state lawmakers voted on Tuesday to open debate on removing the Confederate flag from the State House grounds.

Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old white man charged with nine counts of murder for the shooting at the church last Wednesday, had posed with a Confederate flag in photos posted online with a racist manifesto.

'TO FOSTER RACIAL UNITY'

Just hours after politicians in several southern states began calling for the removal of the Confederate flag on Monday, some of the nation's largest retailers announced they were halting sales of related merchandise.

Prominent U.S. flag makers said on Tuesday they would stop manufacturing and selling Confederate flags.

"We hope that this decision will show our support for those affected by the recent events in Charleston and, in some small way, help to foster racial unity and tolerance in our country," the Pennsylvania-based Valley Forge Flag company said in a statement.

The debate over the rebel flag spread to other southern states on Tuesday.

In Mississippi, the state which still most prominently incorporates the "Stars and Bars" in its flag, Speaker of the House Philip Gunn became the first Republican in state history to publicly support a flag change when he called the Confederate emblem "a point of offense that needs to be removed."

Virginia, which was also part of the Confederacy, will no longer allow special vehicle license plates for the Sons of Confederate Veterans group that feature the flag, Governor Terry McAuliffe said on Tuesday. Georgia's governor said he would seek to redesign a similar license plate in his state.

Opponents of the flag consider it an emblem of slavery, racism and U.S. xenophobia. Supporters say it represents the South's heritage and culture, as well as a memorial to Confederate casualties during the 1861-65 Civil War.

MORE COMPLEX ISSUE, CRITICS SAY

Critics said the Confederate flag, while powerful in its symbolism, was perhaps a far simpler matter to address than the far more complex U.S. issues of racism, discrimination against African Americans and inequality.

As the Confederate flag fluttered only yards away on the grounds of the South Carolina State House, a crowd of about 1,000 listened to politicians and civil rights leaders voice their support for taking down the battle flag.

"Anyone who gets in front of this train is going to get run over," said Leon Howard, a state legislator, referring to the political momentum gathering behind the initiative.

Until recently Republican Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina had been unwilling to discuss the flag.

"The change in opinion in the last day or two is like nothing I have ever seen. It's been a tidal wave," said College of Charleston political science professor Gibbs Knotts.

The crowd heard prayers offered in the memory of State Senator Clementa Pinckney, a longtime advocate of the flag's removal. Pinckney, pastor of the Charleston church, was one of the shooting victims. President Barack Obama will attend his funeral on Friday.

The Confederate flag controversy is the latest flashpoint in a year of intense debate over U.S. race relations, sparked by the killings of unarmed black men by police officers in Ferguson, Missouri; New York City; and Baltimore. The outcry has spawned a reinvigorated civil rights movement under the "Black Lives Matter" banner.

Governor Haley threw her support behind removing the flag on Monday. She called on lawmakers, whose legislative year wraps up this week, to address the issue over the summer and said she would order a special session if they did not.

It would take a two-thirds majority vote by both chambers of the legislature to undo the state law that requires the flag to fly at a memorial to Confederate soldiers on the State House grounds.

That law was the result of a 2000 compromise that removed it from atop the State House, where it was first put up a half century ago at the peak of resistance to federal efforts to end segregation in the South.

Dylann Roof, a 21-year-old white man charged with nine counts of murder for the shooting at the church last Wednesday, had posed with a Confederate flag in photos posted online with a racist manifesto.

'TO FOSTER RACIAL UNITY'

Just hours after politicians in several southern states began calling for the removal of the Confederate flag on Monday, some of the nation's largest retailers announced they were halting sales of related merchandise.

Prominent U.S. flag makers said on Tuesday they would stop manufacturing and selling Confederate flags.

"We hope that this decision will show our support for those affected by the recent events in Charleston and, in some small way, help to foster racial unity and tolerance in our country," the Pennsylvania-based Valley Forge Flag company said in a statement.

The debate over the rebel flag spread to other southern states on Tuesday.

In Mississippi, the state which still most prominently incorporates the "Stars and Bars" in its flag, Speaker of the House Philip Gunn became the first Republican in state history to publicly support a flag change when he called the Confederate emblem "a point of offense that needs to be removed."

Virginia, which was also part of the Confederacy, will no longer allow special vehicle license plates for the Sons of Confederate Veterans group that feature the flag, Governor Terry McAuliffe said on Tuesday. Georgia's governor said he would seek to redesign a similar license plate in his state.

Opponents of the flag consider it an emblem of slavery, racism and U.S. xenophobia. Supporters say it represents the South's heritage and culture, as well as a memorial to Confederate casualties during the 1861-65 Civil War.

MORE COMPLEX ISSUE, CRITICS SAY

Critics said the Confederate flag, while powerful in its symbolism, was perhaps a far simpler matter to address than the far more complex U.S. issues of racism, discrimination against African Americans and inequality.

As the Confederate flag fluttered only yards away on the grounds of the South Carolina State House, a crowd of about 1,000 listened to politicians and civil rights leaders voice their support for taking down the battle flag.

"Anyone who gets in front of this train is going to get run over," said Leon Howard, a state legislator, referring to the political momentum gathering behind the initiative.

Until recently Republican Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina had been unwilling to discuss the flag.

“The change in opinion in the last day or two is like nothing I have ever seen. It’s been a tidal wave,” said College of Charleston political science professor Gibbs Knotts.

The crowd heard prayers offered in the memory of State Senator Clementa Pinckney, a longtime advocate of the flag's removal. Pinckney, pastor of the Charleston church, was one of the shooting victims. President Barack Obama will attend his funeral on Friday.

The Confederate flag controversy is the latest flashpoint in a year of intense debate over U.S. race relations, sparked by the killings of unarmed black men by police officers in Ferguson, Missouri; New York City; and Baltimore. The outcry has spawned a reinvigorated civil rights movement under the "Black Lives Matter" banner.

Governor Haley threw her support behind removing the flag on Monday. She called on lawmakers, whose legislative year wraps up this week, to address the issue over the summer and said she would order a special session if they did not.

It would take a two-thirds majority vote by both chambers of the legislature to undo the state law that requires the flag to fly at a memorial to Confederate soldiers on the State House grounds.

That law was the result of a 2000 compromise that removed it from atop the State House, where it was first put up a half century ago at the peak of resistance to federal efforts to end segregation in the South.

(CNN) -- It happened in a matter of days.

In South Carolina, the governor called for the Confederate flag to stop flying over the capitol. The governors of Virginia and North Carolina quickly declared that they would remove the flag from state license plates. Meanwhile, several of the country's top retailers -- from Walmart to eBay and Amazon -- announced in quick succession that they would stop selling Confederate flag merchandise.

Not for the first time this year, the concerns of political leaders and business elites converged on a single issue -- and swiftly forced dramatic change.

The debate over the Confederate flag is the most recent and vivid illustration of how changes in the business community can influence and pressure politics. Earlier this year, Republican governors in Indiana and Arkansas faced staunch opposition from business leaders on so-called "religious freedom" laws that critics warned would discriminate against gay customers. Both states eventually amended the language in the original bills amid widespread backlash from small and large companies.

The recent skirmishes demonstrate how business leaders in deep-red states, where conservative Republicans control most or all the levers of power, often emerge as checks on elected officials who lean strongly to the right.

"What you are seeing is a broad, acknowledgment across both the consumer, the political and the business community that that particular emblem is no longer part of something that should be a state-issued emblem," Kentucky-based GOP strategist Scott Jennings said of the Confederate flag debate. "To execute change in this country, that kind of convergence matters."

Virginia's lieutenant governor Ralph Northam, who supports Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe's decision to strip the state's license plates of the Confederate flag image, said in an interview Tuesday that businesses played a pivotal role in encouraging elected officials to adopt inclusive and mainstream public policies.

In 2013, the state elected McAuliffe over GOP gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli, the state's ex-attorney general who was criticized for his staunchly conservative social views.

"The business community -- they have a lot of say and power all over the country, whether it's on religion or ethnicity or LGBT issues," Northam, a moderate Democrat, said. "When you're running a business, you have to have the doors open and welcome diversity."

The debate over the Confederate flag came in the aftermath of the tragic, racially-motivated mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, which left nine African-Americans dead in a storied church. The killings sparked furious debate over the use of the Confederate flag on the grounds of the state Capitol.

The verdict from businesses was swift and overwhelming: It was time for the flag to go.

Walmart, Amazon, eBay and Sears announced within the span of one day that they would ban the sale of Confederate flag merchandise from their stores, saying they had no intention of offending customers.

As Walmart CEO Doug McMillon put it, the decision was straightforward: "We want everybody to feel comfortable shopping at Walmart."

Meanwhile, a myriad of companies including Nascar, Boeing, BMW and Michelin also rallied around South Carolina Republican Gov. Nikki Haley as she announced that the Confederate flag could no longer fly over the state house in Columbia.

Carl Blackstone, president of the Columbia Chamber of Commerce, applauded Haley's decision. He said his view on the matter was more than just a business consideration.

"Does it impact business? Yes," Blackstone said. "But we need to bring it down not because of the business impact but because it's the right thing to do. That's the most important thing."

The discussions to discard Confederate symbols and purge them from the marketplace reflect a deeper tension in Southern politics and business.

Corporate and business leaders say that the abandoning the flag is a step towards inclusiveness for a region that has long struggled to shed negative images. It's the same principle, they say, that has driven the business community and Wall Street to be increasingly outspoken on divisive issues like same-sex marriage (some of the country's largest banks and corporations signed a "friend of the court" amicus brief earlier this year requesting the Supreme Court to support same-sex marriage).

Meanwhile, the debate in South Carolina over the Confederate flag seems to be spilling over to neighboring southern states.

In Kentucky, a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis that stands in the capitol building has drawn fresh scrutiny. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and GOP gubernatorial candidate Matt Bevin have both said the statue should be moved to a museum.

And in Mississippi, attention is also turning to the state flag, which includes the Confederate flag in the left top corner. The state's Republican House Speaker Philip Gunn said his state flag had become "a point of offense that needs to be removed."

Former Mississippi Sen. Trent Lott, famous for past racially charged remarks, told CNN this week that the state flag should be changed to the Bonnie Blue flag -- "because that's what the Mississippians carried at the Battle of Monterrey" -- and commended Haley and her fellow South Carolinians for coming together in the face of tragedy.

"I've just been moved to tears by the way they've handled this," Lott said.

Wal-Mart, American bellwether, and the Confederate flag

First came the announcement that Wal-Mart would be raising wages for half a million employees to several dollars above the federally mandated minimum. Then the company issued a curt condemnation of its home state's religious freedom law, which was seen as anti-gay. Then it raised wages for another 100,000 workers. Wal-Mart was only halfway through 2015, and already it was on a progressive roll.

This year has been a remarkable about-face for the company that launched half a century ago in tiny Rogers, Ark., (population 5,700, according to the 1960 census) and has long been associated with a certain brand of publicity-averse small-town conservatism. For years, it refused to stock music with lyrics or album art deemed "objectionable," resisted unionization efforts among its employees and donated the vast majority of campaign contributions to Republican candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

The rest of the time, Wal-Mart avoided wading into cultural debates — founder Sam Walton was so uninterested in making a statement he refused to hire a public relations team, according to Charles Fishman, author of "The Wal-Mart Effect."

"Sam Walton believed you ran a business every day. You don't take symbolic stands," Fishman told The Washington Post.

No longer.

On Monday, the company took another step into the politically and emotionally charged arena of America's culture wars.

In a single sweeping move, it eliminated all Confederate-flag-adorned items from its Web site: a T-shirt emblazoned with the blue, red and gray banner and the words "Rebel Firefighter." A belt buckle bearing the flag and the words "Country Girl." Towels. Bandannas. Swimsuits. And flags, of course. Plenty of them.

"We never want to offend anyone with the products that we offer," spokesman Brian Nick said in a statement. "We have taken steps to remove all items promoting the confederate flag from our assortment — whether in our stores or on our web site."

The decision to banish the flag from Wal-Mart shelves came after several days of heated debate over a Confederate flag flying near the South Carolina state Capitol. In the wake of last week's deadly shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C., critics argued that the flag should be removed from the Capitol grounds — and ultimately, Gov. Nikki Haley (R) agreed.

That activists would question the presence of the flag was not surprising. That presidential candidates and political figures would add their two cents was perhaps even less so.

But for the world's largest retailer to voluntarily wade into the controversy and side against the disputed symbol of the Old South is both a surprise and a sign that Wal-Mart may become an unlikely new bellwether of social change in the United States.

In late March, the company came out strongly against Arkansas's religious freedom law, which opponents said would allow people and corporations to deny service to gays and other minority groups. The law "threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present through the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold," read a statement tweeted by chief executive Doug McMillon.

"They've done a complete 180," Justin G. Nelson, co-founder and president of the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, told the New York Times. In 2008, then-chief executive Mike Duke signed a petition in favor of legislation barring gay couples from adopting in Arkansas. Three years later, the company received a 40 percent grade on the Human Rights Campaign's annual Corporate Equality Index (today that number is 90 percent). It wasn't until 2013 that the company expanded its health insurance benefits to include workers' domestic partners, most of whom were in same-sex relationships. (Same-sex marriage is not legal in Arkansas.)

"The fact that they came out and said that this bill cannot discriminate against LGBT people, that's very powerful to say," Nelson continued. "I don't know that there is a stronger corporate voice that could have said that than Wal-Mart. It's been an evolution. It almost mirrors how America has evolved in those issues."

Wal-Mart's evolution on gay marriage does seem to have paralleled America's, rather than precipitating or following it. Back in 2008, when ex-chief executive Duke was signing petitions to prevent gay couples from adopting, the proportion of people who supported same-sex marriage was about 40 percent. Recent polls have found that 6 in 10 Americans now support same-sex marriage, just as current chief executive McMillon declared his opposition to the Arkansas religious freedom act.

Something similar can be said of Wal-Mart's other recent progressive cause: employee pay. In February, the company announced it would raise wages for half a million workers and followed up with a similar wage hike this month. Like its stance on LGBT issues, the move toward higher wages reflected a broader shift. It was one of a group of companies — Gap, Aetna, Ikea — to raise wages, and a 2014 poll from the Pew Research Center found that 73 percent of voters favored raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.

In both cases, Wal-Mart's decision to align itself with an issue traditionally seen as liberal has been a pragmatic one, according to analysts. The argument for each move is slightly different — the company's stance on LGBT issues is mostly symbolic, while raising the minimum wage has implications beyond the way it is perceived by customers. But both have been framed by the company (which now has plenty of public relations staff) as a statement of values, evidence that the world's largest retailer can act conscientiously.

Even more so than those previous decisions, Wal-Mart's announcement Monday is a dramatic departure from its onetime policy of avoiding controversy.

It didn't need to make a move on the issue — unlike the religious freedom laws that sparked outcries from companies across the country, no other retailer had made the decision to remove all Confederate flag products from its offerings (though Sears also announced that it will be ending third-party sales of the flag on its online marketplace). And this issue in particular touches Wal-Mart at its roots.

"Wal-Mart was born in Arkansas and is the store in some ways of the old Confederacy, the store of the deep South and the heartland. Across the South, Wal-Mart is a hugely prominent force in how people live," Fishman said.

By rejecting the flag that some Southerners still claim as a symbol of their heritage, Wal-Mart "is not just following the cultural conversation, they're shaping it," he said.

It's hard to tell why Wal-Mart made the decision, Fishman said — maybe it came from the top; maybe it came from employees who didn't want to be in the business of ringing up Confederate flag apparel at the checkout line; maybe it was inspired by the chorus of leaders across the political spectrum who seemed to agree Monday that the Rebel flag no longer belongs in the public space. Undoubtedly, it was an expression of horror over the nine slayings at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., last week and sympathy for the victims — feelings that most of the country shares.

Even so, Fishman noted, removing the flag wasn't exactly a hard decision to make, business-wise. "I don't think any digits in Wal-Mart's financial filings will change going forward as a result of this," he said. There would be much higher financial and social costs to eliminating its stocks of firearms, which Wal-Mart sells more of than any other retailer in America.

But still, the Monday announcement sets a precedent, Fishman said. He'll give them credit for that.

"For those of us who watch Wal-Mart," he said, "it's nice to catch them doing the right thing."

[21:00:00]

ANDERSON COOPER, AC 360 HOST: Good evening, 9:00 P.M. here in New York. A lot happening and quite a lot of front starting with the search of two killers and evidence -- hard evidence -- DNA evidence that they might not have gotten more than a few dozen miles from the prison that they first broke out of.

Not much territory, we hope for searchers to focus on the plenty of ground for us to cover including new information about how the killers got their tools.

Let's just say, it will make you think about hamburgers and a totally new way. We begin tonight with Jason Carroll.

JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Searchers calling it one of their strongest leads yet, test now been run on materials found inside a cabin located in a wooded area a little more than 20 miles west of the Clinton County Correctional Facility. Sources tell CNN that DNA matches that of escaped cons, Richard Matt and David Sweat. State police are still cautious about the findings.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MAJ. CHARLES GUESS, NEW YORK STATE POLICE: We have recovered specific items from that cabin. We forwarded them to the appropriate laboratories and reached conclusive determination but we're not prepared to release that evidence at this time.

CARROLL: Search teams descended on the area, road block set up, alerts put out warning residents to be vigilant.

And on Saturday, nearly 300 miles away, word of another possible siding of fugitives near the New York-Pennsylvania border in the town of Friendship.

GUESS: We conducted a thorough search that is now ended. We have declared that area clear.

CARROL: Also, becoming more clear, how the men gathered materials to make their escape.

A source familiar with the investigation tells me investigators are looking at whether tools or other contraband was hidden inside frozen hamburger meat, passed on to Matt, just about a week before the escape, that meat did not pass the metal detector which is a violation of prison policy.

Officials are also looking into whether Joyce Mitchell, the prison employee, now facing charges for her alleged role in the escape may have convinced a guard to pass now the frozen meat. Several guards now under investigation including Gene Palmer. He worked on the so- called honor block where Matt and Sweat were housed. His attorney says Palmer did not know of any escape plans.

ANDREW BROCKWAY, GENE PALMER'S ATTORNEY: Client says it's 20-20. Right now, he sees things that have happened throughout the past year to two years that have opened up his eyes. He's a very proud individual. He thinks that he has information that will be helpful.

CARROLL: Palmer knew both inmates for several years. He accepted several paintings and drawings Matt made for him. Investigators question Palmer for nearly 14 hours, Saturday.

BROCKWAY: Gene was extremely truthful and forthcoming. He wants these two individuals to be caught and anything that he can do to help law enforcement do their job, he's going to cooperate.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

COOPER: And Jason joins us now. Do we know more about this relationship between Gene Palmer and the two inmates?

CARROLL: We do. I mean, Gene Palmer was one of those people who has influenced by Joyce Mitchell. Of all people, she said to Gene Palmer that these were good guys, that they could be trusted and Gene Palmer would use them from time to time as a source, Anderson. When something was going wrong in the prison, he could go them and find out who was about to cause trouble, and so he would use them in that capacity.

And let's be clear, Joyce Mitchell still very much the key figure here. As I said, she influenced not only Gene Palmer in vouching for these two inmates saying that they were good guys, but also she vouched for these two inmates to other guards who were at the prison as well. Anderson?

COOPER: Jason, appreciate it. Just a short time ago, local sheriff wait in and what searchers are up against, but also what the killers are facing if indeed they are in that massive and virtually untamed state part. Listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KEVIN MULVERHILL, OWL'S HEAD SHERIFF, NEW YORK: Well, even in the area where, you know, we think they were last seen, it's a very rough terrain. It's not easy to get through. It's not easy to traverse. There aren't any year round residences. It's all season residences in that particular area. And yesterday, the weather was just totally against the detail and against those inmates as well, you know heavy rain, you know heavy winds. It's been a rough slide so to speak.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

COOPER: That's Alexandra Field interviewing that sheriff. She joins us now. So, he talked about the rough terrain. What else did he say about the search?

ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We're understanding from the sheriff is that while there are tremendous amount of law enforcement resources that have been brought into Franklin County, more than a thousand law enforcement officers helping with the search that local knowledge unit could be key to this search Anderson, not just from local law enforcement officials but also from the public.

[21:05:09] We learned from the sheriff that in order to navigate this terrain, you've really got to have people on the ground to know what they're dealing with. The rangers have been out in the woods here, they are helping with the investigation. We know that investigators are going literally from tree stand to tree stand let alone going door to door, cabin to cabin as they continue to try and track this two fugitives who they believe were in this area tied to that cabin that we have been talking about.

They're also soliciting help from the public though asking for people who have trail camps which are very popular in this area, they're used by hundreds to train -- turn in any video that they may have picked up on those cameras, since this escape has happened.

And again, they're appealing to the public who lives out here, who lives in those woods to notify police if they're seeing anything unusual because, Anderson, you'll remember, it was a witness who was out there in the woods who saw someone running near the cabin and alerted the police that help police found the cabin were they believe that these two fugitives had pulled up for some period of time.

So the sheriff out here telling people, you know, "If you haven't seasonal cabin go check on it. If you see anything out place, a garden who's out of place, it is worth making that call. In this case seemed to have helped, Anderson.

COOPER: How likely is it that the inmates could have navigated it on foot from the prison to that cabin?

FIELD: Yeah. It's the question on everyone's mind, because since this search started there was some degree of confidence that perhaps the inmates hadn't gotten too far. Where we are right now is about 22 miles west of Dannemora, the maximum security prison that they broke out of.

And if you take a look around out here, Anderson, it is really dens forth dens wood you would have imagined that you have no way and navigate out here if you didn't really know the land. But the sheriff is telling me that there are abandoned rail beds that there are power lines and that there's snow mobile and ATV trails that could essentially take you on that trip from Dannemora all the way out here to Owls Head.

So, if they were able to hook in to one of those trails one of those rail beds one of those power lines that they might very well be able to follow those leads and make their way right here.

COOPER: All right. Alexandra, I appreciate the reporting. Thank you. More now on the investigation. Deborah Feyerick joins us again tonight.

In terms of the person who saw -- who's cabin this was who went to check on the cabin or I guess one of the owners of the cabin saw somebody running wasn't sure if he was one of this inmates but DNA showed up, we know there's peanut butter, there was water that was used, we don't know though what may have been taken if anything. Do we?

DEBORAH FEYERICK, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's all part of the investigation to determine exactly what was in that hunting cabin, because there could have been knives, there could have been weapons, it's a very sort of basic kind of cabin but still the investigators have to keep assessing and reassessing where are these guys, what may they -- what could they have attained as they're running, you know.

And one -- all -- another game changer is the fact that these two inmates may well understand that now their cover has been blown. They have been identified, they have been spotted, they knew somebody's coming towards that cabin and that means that they have been identified out of particular location that was something that had not happened until really this past weekend.

COOPER: And I understand your sources are saying authorities maybe concerned that this two could be monitoring communications?

FEYERICK: That's another premise that investigators are working on this scenarios where cellphones do not work very well, some of this cabins do have scanners inside so there are portable scanners and so back have been that they dig it access to, there's a question of what other kind of communications even television were radios or something to that affected they could be listening to as well.

And again, all this plays in to how investigators go after them and try to choke them off from this area.

COOPER: And the truths of the Correction's officer who's being interviewed. Do we know more about him? Is he the person who Joyce Mitchell's believe to have given these frozen hamburgers?

FEYERICK: Well, that's exactly right. And Joyce Mitchell, seems to have a very deep connection with these two inmates. She had relationships...

COOPER: Right. FEYERICK: ... apparently with both of them. And it appears that she may duped this prison guard Gene Palmer into transporting caring this meat into the facility and these the -- on their block that they had, they do have hot plates so the inmates could cook for themselves, and so whether she said, you know, this is not a problem but she may have essentially dupe him into a knowingly carried in particular weapons, you can get, you know, this, this jab saws in that are about six inches long, you can get cutters in, you can even get cellphones. Cellphones are widely popular contraband in...

COOPER: Right.

FEYERICK: ... prison even money. So it's unclear specifically what kind of contraband that they are looking at the possibility that that it was some kind of a tool.

COOPER: All right. Deb Feyerick, I appreciate it. Thank you. Coming up next, what our panel of criminal justice experts make of the new evidence, the closeness to the prison where it was found, what it says about what these two killers could be up to.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[21:13:25] COOPER: The breaking news tonight. DNA evidence in the search for two fugitive killers found in a cabin now far from the prison that they broke out off. An eye witness in the escapee and escape tools possibly smuggled into the prison inside frozen hamburger meat. The corrections officers suspended a lot of moving parts to the story.

Joining us now, Joe Lo Templio, staff writer for the Press-Republican, a local paper. Joe, your newspaper's reporting that the cabin is actually owned by a group of Correction's officers. Now, we have not been able to confirm that independently. CNN hasn't.

Can you say where you're getting that from? And do you have any reason to believe it's anything but a coincidence?

JOE LOTEMPLIO, PRESS-REPUBLICAN STAFF WRITER: As far as I know, it is just that, a coincidence because there are several -- many of those hunting camps in that area and many of them are own by Correction officers. If they're not owned, they are often leased by parties, groups of people together that lease them for the hunting season. And for what I'm told that this group of COs leased this hunting camp in this area that they're looking.

COOPER: The attorney for Mr. Palmer, one of the Correction's officers being interviewed, the attorney told us he didn't know if Mr. Palmer was one the people who lease this cabin. Do you have any know knowledge of whether he is involved in this?

LOTEMPLIO: No. I don't believe he is.

COOPER: OK. In terms of who allegedly discovered that something was amiss at the cabin, what that person claims to have seen. Can you walk us through what you know? LOTEMPLIO: Yeah. From what we were told from our sources that know this party in this individual that went to the camp.

[21:15:05] He went to check on the camp sometime Saturday, was alerted to something that somebody was or something was going on, saw something on the porch that wasn't right and saw a two figures inside the hunting camp.

We're told that he ordered them to come out and hand a weapon with him and he saw a two individual's exit the front of the camp which was actually the other side. He came in from the rear and -- but he did not -- could not say for sure if it was the individuals that everybody's looking for.

COOPER: So he actually is -- your understanding is he actually saw a two individuals in that cabin because on the DNA evidence...

LOTEMPLIO: Right. And...

COOPER: ... before (inaudible) both men inside.

LOTEMPLIO: Yeah, that's what we're told. Again, it's not, you know, it hasn't been confirmed definitely by law enforcement yet. And we're also told that the items found in the cabin were a jug of water and a jar of peanut butter that were out on the table in the camp that this individual saw.

COOPER: Have you - do you have any sense of how long authorities believe this escapees might have been inside the cabin and if there were any weapons or supplies inside the cabin that they could had access to?

LOTEMPLIO: Yeah. It's uncertain how long but we do know that there is a whole string of these camps in that area and theoretically these guys could be hopping from camp to camp to camp and I'm told that there is a lot of can goods in these camps. Some have a lot of alcohol in them, some may have weapons but most hunters don't leave their weapons there when they're not in hunting season in. Hunting season around here, you know, is primarily in the fall September, October, November. And so they're be empty for a long time.

COOPER: Yeah. Well, Joe -- Joe LoTemplio, I appreciate you've been on tonight. Thank you.

I want to bring in our panels, CNN contributor and forensic scientist Lawrence Kobilinsky of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Also, John Cuff is back former head of the Northeast Fugitive Investigation Division at the U.S Marshal Service, and former FBI profiler Mary Ellen O'Toole.

Certainly, John, on the deciding the DNA you called this a game changer.

JOHN CUFF, FMR. HEAD OF THE NORTHEAST FUGITIVE INVESTIGATION DIVISION, U.S MARSHAL SERVICE: This is a huge a game changer, Anderson, I mean it's a big significant break for a law enforcement. This is the closest to scent that they've had since those dogs last week. So the DNA found in the cabin along with the possible sighting of these two individuals certainly reenergizes this law enforcement effort on the hunt. And also, it allows the law enforcement to cast the net out in that area there just two perimeter work in that type thing.

COOPER: Professor Kobilinsky, I mean the DNA it was seems to been identified pretty quickly often it seems in a lot of this cases we hear well you can't get DNA for a week or two?

LAWRENCE KOBILINSKY, FORENSIC SCIENTIST: Well, first of all these are convicted felons, therefore, their genetic profiles are on CODIS, the national database. So we have that background information on both of them.

Now in terms of the technology, it's extraordinary. What we can do nowadays, there's a piece of equipment called rapid that can actually get a genetic profile in 90 minutes.

COOPER: Wow.

KOBILINSKY: I don't think they used it in these case but one day is not unusual if you really prioritize and you put your people there day and night.

COOPER: And any of you have the genetic profile of people already on.

KOBILINSKY: Absolutely. Absolutely. What you need is biological evidence so apparently that's what they find in the cabin, we don't know exactly what. I mean at first I was thinking it might be a toothbrush or a hairbrush or a comb, or an item of clothing they can scrape clothing for DNA.

We're not sure about that but whatever it is, it certainly led to...

COOPER: You just scrape the clothing for DNA for like for dead skin?

KOBILINSKY: Absolutely. Wherever clothing comes in close contact with the skin with his friction, for example the collar on a shirt, your going to be able to scrape it and get as much DNA as you need to get a profile. No problem.

COOPER: And how long they were there? That's obviously not something you can tell for the DNA.

KOBILINSKY: Well you can't do it with DNA. You can't tell when DNA was deposited. There maybe other ways of determining when they where in that cabin by the food they ate and other factors but not through DNA.

COOPER: Mary Ellen, with law enforcement I mean seemingly closing in on them, if this in fact them. How does that affect fugitives' behavior if they know police are on the trail which they - I mean they certainly must assume that police are on their trail. Is there a pattern?

MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, FBI PROFILER: Well, for these two people and particularly for the one, Richard Matt, he's still dealing with -- I mean he's still a psychopath and what his not going to be as fearful as someone who doesn't have those personality traits.

[21:20:04] He also has very unrealistic goals and thinking that he can get out of these. So those two things are really going to dominate and his not going to give up willingly. He also believe -- he's very optimistic and he thinks that he can beat this. So, they're not going to be as fearful as you would expect someone else to be.

And, one of the first things that he would have been thinking about when he got away from the prison is knowing that plan A, she was about there to meet them presumably is obtaining weapons of some kind so that he would have those in the event that he needed them.

COOPER: Does it surprise you, Mary Ellen, that they are still together?

ELLEN: In some ways it does. But they needed each other. They're not together because they are the best of friends.

They need one another particularly, Matt. And at the point where Sweat would have been a problem or wouldn't have gone along with it, he would be dispensable. They -- he would have gotten rid of them.

But right now they really did need each other because this has been a 24 hour around the clock situation and someone had to sleep while someone else was looking around to see if there were other people, so they are using each other which is classic psychopathic behavior.

COOPER: Mary Ellen O'Toole, I appreciate it, John Cuff as well, Professor Kobilinsky, thank you. Just ahead, we have new details about the shooter in the Charleston Church massacre. When his racist views began taking shape and what influenced them or who influenced them.

Plus, major development stating the battle to remove the Confederate Flag from South Carolina's Capital grounds, we'll talk to the State lawmakers who is introducing legislation to get it down.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[21:25:40] COOPER: In Charleston, South Carolina, funeral plans are being made for the nine people murdered inside the historic Emanuel AME church.

On Friday, President Obama's going to deliver the eulogy at the funeral service for Reverend Clementa Pinckney, their pastor and a widely respected state senator.

On Wednesday, Senator Pinckney's casket will be at the state house in Columbia for public viewing. And the push to remove the confederate flag from the state house grounds accelerated today. We have more than that ahead. But first investigation and new details about the confessed killer, who told police he wanted to start a race war.

Martin Savidge joins me now. So talk to me about what you learned about the shooters history with racist ideology.

MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know it's interesting. It's obvious a self-evolution of hatred that he had because those who knew him growing up, friends say that he didn't seem to be this firebrand of a racist then. And if you believe that manifesto that it's his writing, he says that he wasn't raised by a racist family in any way.

He said that with the George Zimmerman, Trayvon Martin tragedy, it really changed him. He went online right across a racist website. He said he hasn't been the same since. So that was kind of his patriot awakening.

And then, we know, moving forward to this year, he started his own racist website. He got a gun and then he began kind of this weird journey through all these spots across South Carolina. The notorious one's dealing with slavery and the revered one's dealing with the confederacy. He was drinking and his friends also say he's taken pills and he was getting angrier.

And then we know, last Wednesday, he showed up at the side door of Emanuel AME Church. So that's the journey. And a very sick one it is.

COOPER: And about President Obama's trip on Friday, do we know details?

SAVIDGE: Well, we know of course that the President is coming. We're told that the first lady is coming as well and the Vice President. I mean that's really significant to have all three with the Vice President and the President in the same place. And as we pointed out, the President will deliver the eulogy because this was just a victim, this was a person he knew, and of course, he's a representative as well as being a reverend.

So in many ways, he is the epitome and represents all of those who died but of course, you can bet that the President will be recalling all nine victims. Many are wondering if he'll come to the church himself. Anderson.

COOPER: Martin, thank you for the reporting.

Two big pieces of breaking news tonight. We just learned that Mississippi House Speaker, Philip Gunn, a Republican, now says the Confederate battle flag emblem should be taken off the state flag. That is it right there.

And earlier say, the worlds' biggest retailer made a very big announcement. Walmart is removing all confederate flag merchandise from its stores and there's not the only development in the wake of the Charleston tragedy.

With the Confederate flag still flying full staff on the ground to the Capitol, Republican Governor Nikki Haley, flanked by-law makers including Republican Senators Tim Scott and Lindsey Graham, said it was time for the flag to go. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

GOV. NIKKI HALEY, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA: Today, we are here in a moment of unity in our state without ill will to say its time to move the flag from the capitol ground.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

COOPER: Well, Senator Graham put out a statement reading a part, "In the worst of tragedies, we have seen the best of South Carolina. Today, I am urging that the Confederate battle flag be removed from state house grounds to an appropriate location." Republican Party chairman quickly endorsed the move in a stringer GOP candidates would be candidates also got onboard.

Joining me now is South Carolina State Representative, Doug Brannon.

Representative Brannon, I appreciate you being with us. I know you were a friend of Senator Pinckney and I'm sorry for your loss.

Can you explain to me why you believe it's important that the Confederate flag now be taken down form the Capitol grounds?

DOUG BRANNON, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA STATE REPRESENTATIVE: In honor of the Senator and the other eight people that were so tragically murdered the other night, its just time. It's no longer --that flag can no longer be on our state Capitol ground. That Capitol ground needs to be a place of progress for everybody and right now, its not.

COOPER: I know the Post Courier newspaper on Charleston have been reaching out to everyone on the state legislature to see how they vote. And it seems to me, they're reporting that as of this evening, roughly half of all law makers have yet to return their calls or e- mails. The majority of those who did talks that they support removing it. Seems like a lot of representatives still kind of want to dodge the question or not be on record right now. What do you say to that?

[21:30:03]

BRANNON: Well, you know, I'm not going to speak for any member of the House except for myself but I knew and I said this yesterday. My desire to introduce this bill was going to make people take a stand. And I'm so thankful for Governor Haley's announcement today and for Senator Graham and Senator Scott taking the positions that they've taken. It's not just this bill. It's those voices that are making these people take a stand. And it's time to take that stand.

COOPER: You said earlier though, you think you could lose your reelection because of this?

BRANNON: Yes, that's very possible.

COOPER: You're -- I mean certainly you're a Republican, to the Republican presidential candidate who say this is not worthy of a national discussion. Some candidates as you said have taken a stand, others have said, this is not something that a presidential candidate or a president should weigh in on. What do you -- do you believe that, that this isn't something that they should weigh in on?

BRANNON: No, I don't believe that. Anderson, I'm not really a politician, I'm an elected official. And I'm not a politician because I'm not going to say what I think you want to hear, I'm going to say what I think.

So, if you ask me what I think about the flag, I'm going to tell you, I would ask the presidential candidates to do the same. Do I think they have to? That's up to them, but I wish they would take a position.

COOPER: The fact that you have Governor Haley, you have Senators Graham and Scott, they are all now saying, "Look, take down the flag." Do you believe that this actually will happen? Would you think is a tipping point?

BRANNON: I'm not going to predict, but I know that the current is significantly swifter today as I talk to you than it was Friday when it was released that I had a bill that I wanted to introduce.

So, I certainly believe there's momentum. I think there's enough votes in the house to get the two thirds. I hope there's enough in the Senate. I know that standing next to Governor Haley was Senator Leatherman who is without question the most powerful senator. He was there. That's got to mean something. So I'm hopeful that we've got the votes in both bodies.

COOPER: Well, Representative Brannon, I appreciate your time tonight, we'll be following it closely, thank you very much.

BRANNON: Thank you for having me.

COOPER: Just ahead, Drew Griffin tracking down the guy behind the website, of the hate group that the Charleston church shooter credited in his so-called manifesto.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[21:36:35] COOPER: The 21 year old man has confessed to murdering nine people in South Emmanuel AME Church told friends and also police he wanted to start a race war. We aren't using his name or pictures of him because we don't want to give him any more recognition.

But, by now, you've probably seen the pictures of him wearing patches featuring the flag of Apartheid-Era South African Rhodesia. He's also posted a rambling manifesto filled with racist rants.

In it he writes on the Trayvon Martin case was a turning point for him. He also credits the website of the Council of Conservative Citizens for changing the way he saw the world.

Drew Griffin has been digging into this group the CCC. He managed to track down it's webmaster and joins us now.

So the Southern Poverty Law Center, they identified the CCC as a hate group, what did you learn about them. DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: They a re a group that believes that the white race is under attack, is being under attacked both in Europe and the United States and really across the world.

And it post on its website, or at least it has, kind of showing all these black on white crimes. List after list of black on white crimes, trying to emphasize their point that white people are the actual victims in all that's going on across the world.

And you mentioned Kyle Rogers, he is the webmaster, one of the leaders of the group according to the SPLC, who lives just about 20 miles north of here. And when I went to his door today to try to see if he'd repeat some of the claims he made in some rallies that were posted on the Internet. He basically shut the door in my face, handed me a piece of paper and told me - on paper, told me to call the spokes person who is outside of Washington, D.C., Anderson.

COOPER: And you did talk to the spokesperson and his name is Jared Taylor, what did he tell you about the shooter being motivated by their website?

GRIFFIN: He said that the website, the Council takes absolutely no responsibility for what the shooter did in this church behind me. But says that, "Listen if we post the facts on our website and somebody takes that information and acts upon it, what can we do about it." Basically I want to tell you he said, "We absolutely condemn what that person did, but it does not detract from the legitimacy of his position."

So this group and other groups like it, although they are very tiny, very small, Anderson, they have a white nationalistic agenda and we believe based on his own writings that the shooter visited this website and self proclaims that he was inspired by what was on this website. Anderson.

COOPER: All right. Drew , I appreciate it. Thank you. Joining me now is Richard Cohen, President of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Also Christian Picciolino - excuse me Picciolini, former Skinhead and author of Romantic Memoirs of an American Skinhead. He's also Co- founder of Life After Hate.

Richard you say that although this group is known as extremist, to many they actually been politically active for a long time even though they may be the largest White Supremacist group in the nation.

RICHARD COHEN, PRESIDENT, SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER: It's right, that's incredible, Anderson. You know, up until the mid 2000s, you know, scores of Republican politician would routinely go to their meetings, address the group. Eventually most of them are embarrassed but not all.

Kyle Rogers, the webmaster for the CCC at least as late as 2013 was a member of the Executive Committee of the Republican Party of his county.

[21:40:05] And one of Nikki Haley's member of her Steering Committee on the reelection in 2013 was also a Council Board Member.

So the council is an unusual, you know, kind of hate group. It's repugnant and racist to its core yet it's had some mainstream acceptance unfortunately particularly in the deep South.

COPPER: Christian, you at one time as we said, you were white supremacist, I think at the age of 14, what were some of the ways that you found yourself being radicalized? I mean, was the web critical for you?

CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI, CO-FOUNDER OF LIFE AFTER HATE: Well, Anderson it was pre-internet largely. So I was a member from 1987 to 1995, from the time I was 14 until I was 21.

And, you know, the way that these recruiters radicalize these people is that they put the fear of God them. They think that they say that the white race is being attacked from all sides. They always placed the blame for what's happening in your life elsewhere with minorities, with Jews, with blacks.

And, you know, some of these kids who join these groups, I mean these young people who join these groups think that they're doing it for the right reason. They think that they're going to help their family, they think that they're going to help themselves and they feel like they're patriots but they're misguided and their -- these recruiters, these extremists know how to target these young people so that they believe this ideology right away. So that they jump in head first and then they radicalize them.

COPPER: Richard, it's interesting and I read this guys, you know, so- called manifesto and it's basically just kind of -- the kind of racist parable, the racist boiler plate that's been spewed by -- I mean, by racists for a long, long time about black people, about Jews, about other minority groups.

It's amazing to me that -- I mean, given this day and age that it's kind of just base racism still can take hold with somebody.

COHEN: Yeah. You know, but I think Chris is right. We see some marginalized young people who are adrift, had no read connections with others and are looking for reasons outside of themselves to explain their failure.

And suddenly they realized that, you know, they can be heroic if they, you know, strike a blow for the white race.

At the end of this -- the Charleston shooter's manifesto he said, "Hey, you know, I might not be worth more than a speck of dirt but, you know, I'm going to do something good for society." He said, "I'm the one brave one." So instead of being a down and out kid with no future, suddenly he's a hero to the white race.

COOPER: Christian, I mean, as you read the manifesto, are there similarities in the type of rhetoric that this guy used that you were being told as a teen by other White supremacists? PICCIOLINI: You know, I just published my book in April, Anderson, and he literally could have torn out pages from my book and post it online and it would have played exactly the same way.

The rhetoric is the same, the belief system is the same, the ideology becomes extreme. It's always about blaming other people. This is something that had -- the recruiting methods haven't changed in 20 -- in 30 years. And he could have taken a page exactly like thousands of other kids that are recruited and there -- I think that there are other people just like Dylan Roof out there that are waiting to be radicalized, that are becoming so extreme that they think that their only way out is to cause mass violence.

COOPER: Christian Picciolini, I appreciate you being with us, Richard Cohen as well. Thank you.

Up next, President Obama uses a racial slur in an interview making a dramatic point about racism. What he said and what others are saying about his use of that work when we continue.

(COMERCIAL BREAK)

[21:47:27] COOPER: Well, just days after the shooting of nine African-Americans at Charleston's Emanuel AME Church at the hands with confessed killer who support white supremacist, President Obama says the United States has not overcome its history of racism and used the N-word to make his point. He said it during interview with the podcaster Marc Maron. Now, even if you agree with the point Mr. Obama was making, we might still find the language hard to take.

(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)

PRES. BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Racism, we are not cured of it, clearly. And it's not just a matter of it not being polite to say nigger in public. That's not the measure of whether racism still exists or not. It's not just a matter of overt discrimination. We have -- societies don't, overnight, completely erase everything that happened 200 to 300 years prior.

(END AUDIO CLIP)

COOPER: It's got a lot of people talking, certainly joining me New York Times Op-Ed columnist and CNN political commentator Charles Blow, Cultural critic and writer Michaela Angela Davis and former federal prosecutor and CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin.

Charles, do you think it was appropriate for the president to use it?

CHARLES BLOW, NEW YORK TIMES OP-ED COLUMNIST: Well, I think it was, it's a context issue right. And that he was using to be illustrative and to say how bad it is in fact to use it publicly but it was not used as an invective and I think that is the real point where you have to draw the line. And in fact, when we look at other presidents in how they have use it and has been as an invective.

Second, he was saying it into mic. He was very conscious of the fact that he was saying this would be recorded, it's being broadcast. The other presidents were not doing that. They were doing it behind close doors. Never with the many probably most all would never know knowing that he would ever be see the light of day.

And I think that that kind of being forthright not easy as an infective using it as an instructive tool is actually a context that is important to have. Could he have made the same point in by saying N-word in that context just he would what we have also been talking about it all day.

COOPER: No, not at all. Sunny, you disagree.

SUNNY HOSTIN, FMR. FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: I do and I hear what you're saying and you're my friend but bottom line is I think it is beneath the dignity of his office. I think that you can have an open and honest dialog about race and about racism without using racial epithets.

COOPER: But to Charles' point we probably wouldn't be talking about his conversation on this podcast about race in America had he not use this word.

HOSTIN: I think on balance, it wasn't worth it because what happens when we have the president of the United State using that term. That now gives license to other people to -- for other people to use it.

(CROSSTALK)

HOSTIN: Wait a minute. And what we all could hear from races what we also often hear from other people is well black people use it all the time. Rappers use it all the time. Why can't we use it and no one should use the term that big issue.

[21:50:10]

COOPER: Michaela, what about that, is the president allowed to use that word given the context he was using it?

MICHAELA ANGELA DAVIS, CULTURAL CRITIC AND WRITER: Well, first of all, if you GoogleObama being called the N-word, pages come on, right? So this isn't the first license, right? People have been calling him that all the time and I wish those same people would have been open arms when someone called the President an N-word as they are with him using it, right? And that they would spend as much attention to the people to whom it refers as they are doing with this word. They are so obsessed with the N-word and not obsessed with black people.

HOSTIN: And perhaps that's why no one should use it.

COOPER: But if there was a white president using that word...

DAVIS: No.

COOPER: ... using that word, they were not...

DAVIS: No. And this is a very modern president, right? First of all, he's in a podcast in a garage.

(CROSSTALK)

Wait, wait, let's finish. No, this is that basic rule if you are not it, you cannot say it.

HOSTIN: See. And I think that...

DAVIS: So there are groups, right? If you are black, if you are gay, if you are woman, if you are overweight, there's the beauty of language that it can be fluid and have duality be complex...

HOSTIN: Words hurt, Michaela. Words hurt, words matter.

DAVIS: When they are used with the intent to...

(CROSSTALK)

COOPER: One at a time. One at a time.

HOSTIN: To say that African-Americans can use the term but white people can't, I think is really being intellectually dishonest. The bottom line is no one should be allowed to use the word. We need to retire the word. We are the only group of people...

BLOW: Well...

DAVIS: That is not true, Sunny.

HOSTIN: ... that use racial epithets...

COOPER: OK. Charles.

HOSTIN: ... to describe ourselves. I don't hear Spanish people doing it. I don't hear Asian people doing it. I don't hear...

DAVIS: You need more friends.

HOSTIN: I don't hear gay people using it trying to reclaim...

DAVIS: James Bolster (ph).

BLOW: I don't know what...

COOPER: OK one at a time. Charles.

BLOW: Like I said, you're my friend but I don't know where you've been, Sunny.

DAVIS: I'm here (ph).

BLOW: But, you know, the...

HOSTIN: I've been alive and well and the subjects ofd that word.

BLOW: ... but the idea... COOPER: OK, let Charles do respond.

BLOW: ... but the idea of the reclamation of language and the N-group usage of language that is meant to hurt you and playing around with it in order to make it less harmful to you the next time that you hear it has a very long history and it is not just black people, it is all the groups that Michaela just pointed out.

And whether or not you can debate whether or not that is the proper way to deal with the painful part of that language, but you cannot say that it does not happen and you cannot say that that we can extract these words because in fact they're important to the language.

And so, it's all for you. And if you use them in a way to educate people as a president I believe is attempting to do in this -- at least to a several times, he's basically saying that this is a word that we don't say...

COOPER: Wait, what about -- OK, what about -- Michaela, what about rappers using it in, you know, in...

DAVIS: In artistic way? Yeah, sure.

COOPER: ... rap songs.

DAVIS: I mean, I wouldn't want to take that.

HOSTIN: See, so it's all OK.

DAVIS: Wait, wait, I wouldn't want to take that word away from Kendrick Lamar. I wouldn't want to take that word away from Jay-Z. I wouldn't want to...

HOSTIN: We have a million words in our language.

DAVIS: ... but here's the thing.

HOSTIN: Why can't we take that word away?

DAVIS: Here's the thing, the way that the President used it for -- the way that the President used it is showing us that we can't keep talking about race in this simplistic margins, right, by just a word or a symbol that we are getting to structural systemic racism. And that if we only keep it surrounded by this word, we're going to be lost in that shuffle.

BLOW: And Sunny, I said I believe what you're saying is incredibly dangerous...

HOSTIN: And you can't, of course, out of culture.

BLOW: ...to language.

HOSTIN: What I am saying is incredibly dangerous using the word is incredibly dangerous. Words matter, Charles.

BLOW: No, no, no, the President...

HOSTIN: You know that.

BLOW: Exactly.

HOSTIN: You are a wordsmith, so is the President.

BLOW: And let me -- and I'll tell you exactly what I'll tell you.

HOSTIN: He was trying to be provocative and I thought it was inappropriate.

BLOW: The President used that word many times in his own memoir...

DAVIS: That's right.

BLOW: ... because it was instructive to the history and the meaning of the word at the moment, I wrote a memoir, I use that word several times in my memoir because it was important to be instructive to the history and the meaning of that word in that moment, how it was used to hurt me, how people used to reclaim it. The idea that we should exercise worst from the language I always find danger.

DAVIS: Dangerous.

BLOW: I believe that we need to use it in exactly the way their President was attempting to use it which is to be instructive to say that...

COOPER: Charles...

HOSTIN: As an attorney...

COOPER: ... rappers, rappers using it every...

BLOW: No, I would take you to the artistic thing and I'd say, look at our archive if you want to look at it. We -- what we've done...

HOSTIN: Look, you're talking about freedom of speech though.

BLOW: We've done nudity...

HOSTIN: Talking about freedom of speech.

COOPER: Let him answer this one.

BLOW: ... we've done nudity in art when it was not appropriate to walk down the street naked and we took our kids to museum, they saw naked -- statues of naked people. We do things in art as expression that it separate from how we conduct ourselves civilly on the street. And I believe that that is a separate conversation from this conversation.

COOPER: OK. Sunny.

HOSTIN: I hear what they are saying but I am so surprised that my friend is so smart, so insightful are defending the use of a word...

BLOW: Educationally.

HOSTIN: ... that -- of a word. Any of our civil rights leaders historically have shun, have instructed people not to use them. We are embracing a word that is so painful, so hurtful.

[21:55:00] And I of all people as an attorney, always defend free speech, but when you're talking about this particular term being used by rappers, being used now by the President and now by the way being played over and over again on CNN which is also shocking to me because we've had reporters have to apologize for using that term yet now, because the President of the United States used it, I have probably heard it 10 to 20 times on this very network.

Garment workers in Wal-Mart&#39;s Asia supply chain are being subjected to serious labour violations and abuse, a report has claimed.

Workers rights groups Jobs with Justice Education Fund and Asia Floor Wage Alliance joined forces to investigate conditions throughout the apparel giant&#39;s garment supply chain in India, Cambodia and Indonesia.

In their report, the groups accuse Wal-Mart of failing to take any responsibility for abuses in its supply chain where, in Cambodia in particular, it is estimated to indirectly employ 45,000 workers through its supplier factories.

The report noted "numerous instances of rampant wage theft, violations of workers’ internationally recognised rights to create and join unions and chronic gender and sexual harassment" from factory managers throughout the garment sector in all three countries.

Examples included, wage-theft practices such as incorrect payment of wages based on skill level, denial of legally stipulated overtime rates, and late payment, in India.

Around 86% of the Cambodian workers that took part in the survey told of being forced to work overtime, with a typical day of 10-14 hours, no option to leave prior to overtime beginning, and being forced to work Sundays and national holidays.

In Indonesia, when workers raised important grievances at a Wal-Mart supplier factory, it is understood management terminated all trade union officials and almost all union members, replacing them with new workers. When the trade union protested, a paramilitary organisation was used to disperse protesters, the report revealed.

Other highlights of the report include manipulations to avoid following labour laws, such as sub-contracting, and "abysmal" working conditions, with toilets often in "a filthy and unusable condition or absent altogether".

Workers also voiced "serious concerns about their access to clean drinking water and about overheating".

And in India, women workers said they felt forced to endure sexual harassment in order to meet production targets or to receive benefits. Complaining more often than not, leads to termination, they said.

Wal-Mart didn&#39;t respond to a request for comment on the report, which describes the retail giant as "notorious for being the most difficult large brand to communicate with".

"Whereas other large brands, even those who have received negative attention in recent years, have representatives on the ground in Asian countries, Wal-Mart remains one of the few large brands that do not provide local representation for compliance issues," authors noted.

The report provided a number of recommendations for Wal-Mart if it wants to "ensure workers’ and human rights are enforced and respected" in its supply chain.

These included instituting CSR-compliance representatives in supplier countries to discuss enforcement of rights with local unions and suppliers; launching an investigation into abuses by its suppliers, and taking the necessary steps to correct violations; and opening dialogue with the Asia Floor Wage Alliance about closing the gap between the minimum wage and living wage across the garment sector in Asia.

"This report provides a detailed look at what happens when a major corporate actor shirks its responsibility to maintain basic labour and human rights standards," it notes. "As the world’s largest retailer, and thus as the trendsetter for the production of all manner of products, Wal-Mart has an obligation to ensure dignity for the people who create its products."

Walmart’s black mark

Cambodian workers producing garments for global retail giant Walmart say they are subjected to a slew of workplace abuses ranging from forced labour to sexual harassment. Employees at numerous Walmart supplier factories across the country have made the allegations, which were compiled in a recent study exposing the brand’s “heinous abuses” in three of the major countries in its Asian supply chain – Cambodia, India and Indonesia. The study into Walmart, which was published by workers rights groups Jobs with Justice Education Fund and Asia Floor Wage Alliance, accuses the mega-brand of using its “large and complex supply infrastructure … [to] conceal the exploitation”. It states that the brand, which Forbes lists as the world’s largest retailer, fails to take any responsibility for abuses in its supply chain, where in Cambodia alone it is estimated to indirectly employ 45,000 people through its supplier factories.

 Leaked export records obtained from a source in the transportation industry show that more than 13,500 tonnes of Walmart garments and footwear were exported from Sihanoukville Autonomous Port last year to countries including the US, Canada, France, Germany and the UK. But despite its investment in Cambodia giving the brand “huge leverage” to improve working conditions, Walmart remains “right on the bottom” when it comes to protecting workers rights, according to Joel Preston, a consultant with the Community Legal Education Centre, which authored the Cambodia section of the report. “We’ve seen some steps from other brands to try and remedy abuses … but Walmart’s commitment to labour rights in Cambodian factories is next to zero,” he said. Varying complaints from workers suggest exploitation at Walmart supplier factories is extensive. In all of the 14 factories included in the study, workers told CLEC that they were being “subjected to forced labour of at least one form”. While an average working week in a Cambodian garment factory is advertised as eight hours per day, six days per week, 86 per cent of those who participated in the study “reported that their typical workday was 10 to 14 hours and that they did not have the option to leave the factory prior to overtime hours beginning”. For many of the workers, the overtime itself was not voluntary. “Many factories refuse to give permission to workers to leave before overtime hours are over, while other workers reported fear that their contract would not be renewed if they argued,” the study says. Forced labour also extends to weekends, national holidays and even to times when workers fall ill, which is “particularly problematic” in the March to November hot season, as it overlaps with the industry’s 10-month peak-production period. At this time, “mass fainting episodes regularly occur as a direct result of overexertion without proper nutrition”, it says. Twenty-nine-year-old Kim Sokheng, a worker at Ghim Li (Cambodia), which the report identifies as a supplier of women’s apparel to the retail giant, said in an interview this week that she was often unable to take sick leave. “They [the factory] need us to take sick leave in advance, but how can we know which day we are sick?” she asked. “The company should stop cutting wages when the workers are ill.” But, Sokheng said, a strong union presence in the factory made her confident to protest against such “injustices”, which she said she was hopeful Walmart would address. Her optimism, however, is not shared by everyone. Respondents at all 14 factories included in the study reported instances of union busting by factory owners. Five of the factories did not allow unionisation at all, while four had unions established and run by the employers, and two had pro-government unions. “In at least one case, workers reported that management specifically blocked efforts to create a union or go on strike.” Factory worker Soth Kunthea said in an interview that she was sacked along with about 2,000 of her co-workers last year from a Walmart supplier, Taiwanese-owned Juhui Footwear, after protesting against poor working conditions. After a mass walkout of about 5,000 factory staff in September 2014, the firm allowed 3,000 to return to work, but not before violent clashes with police left dozens injured. Kunthea said workers were only allowed to go to the toilet four times a day, and were often forced to work on weekends and public holidays. She claimed the factory hid such abuses from Walmart, ordering workers not to report them to the brand. In nearly every factory included in the study, workers “voiced serious concerns about their access to clean drinking water and sanitary toilet facilities and about overheating”. Other alleged abuses and exploitative practices included the unlawful use of fixed-duration contracts, insufficient medical facilities and sexual harassment by line leaders and supervisors. At one supplier factory, workers reported that “tolerating the harassment made work easier and allowed them greater opportunities to earn benefits”. Factories contacted for this story denied the allegations, insisting that they complied with Cambodia’s Labour Law. “We always respect the law and avoid anything that would affect workers rights,” said Chan Davuth, administrative manager at the Cambo Handsome factory, adding “we often analyse the problems of the workers”. Walmart, meanwhile, declined to respond to specific questions about the report but said it was committed to its Cambodian workers. “Walmart is part of the International Labour Organization Better Factories Cambodia program, which covers all apparel and footwear factories in Cambodia,” the brand said. “In addition, we actively engage with other brands, NGOs and the Cambodian government to support better transparency and dialogue among stakeholders.” However, the study argues that Walmart is in fact “notorious for being the most difficult large brand to communicate with”. “Whereas other large brands, even those who have received negative attention in recent years, have representatives on the ground in Asian countries, Walmart remains one of the few large brands that do not provide local representation for compliance issues,” it says. Preston of CLEC said problems in the supply chain could be directly attributed to Walmart. “It’s their absolute failure to monitor and to engage.”

WASHINGTON -- When New York state attorney general Eric Schneiderman accused four major retailers--GNC, Target, Walmart and Walgreens--of selling supplements with inaccurate labeling earlier this year, it set in motion a series of product recalls, heightened media scrutiny, and increased interest and awareness as to just what exactly is in dietary supplements and how they are regulated.

In fact, since the New York attorney general's action, Indiana's attorney general, Greg Zoeller, teamed up with Schneiderman in asking Congress to put more teeth into federal regulation of the dietary supplement industry. A dozen other states have since joined New York and Indiana in calling for congressional involvement.

The results of the attorney general's tests, according to Schneiderman's office, revealed that many of the dietary supplements on the shelves at these retailers did not contain the herbs listed on the labels and instead contained only cheap fillers, some of which could prove harmful to those with certain food allergies or negatively interact with medication.

But while there appears to be broad support and agreement among the various regulatory bodies, medical and science communities, and industry players to ban products spiked with illegal substances such as BM-PEA--a dangerous amphetamine-like drug, which Harvard scientists discovered in some popular weight loss supplement brands--there is growing opinion that the method of testing used by Schneiderman's office that initiated the recalls and to justify his demand that the retailers remove the products from their stores might have been flawed.

According to the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the root of the problem with the attorney general's method of testing --DNA barcoding--is that it only tested the plant extracts, which are used to produce the supplements but do not contain the DNA of the material from the base plant itself. CRN's position was bolstered in March when GNC reached an agreement with the attorney general after independent testing verified the authenticity and compliance of its product lines.

That agreement "wrongly perpetuates the misdirected notion that DNA barcode testing is appropriate for herbal supplements, when it is not," said CRN president and chief executive officer Steve Mister. "Moreover, the agreement gives credence to the New York attorney general's misguided allegations based on its own DNA barcoding testing that legitimate quality concerns existed about the products marketed by four retailers, when there was none. "

Mister added that DNA barcoding remains a "flawed method for across-the-board testing" for analyzing the quality of botanical ingredients and finished products. As CRN noted, the FDA does not require DNA barcoding for dietary supplements, nor does it rely solely on such testing in identifying herbal extracts.

Taking sides with CRN is former director of the Food and Drug Administration's division of dietary supplement programs Daniel Fabricant, who is now the CEO and executive director for the Natural Products Association.

In Fabricant's view, the attorney general's action against the four retailers amounted to government harassment.

"Attorney general Schneiderman has admitted that the federal Good Manufacturing Practices currently in place for dietary supplements are sufficient, and companies such as GNC are in compliance with those, but yet he moves forward in his request to spend federal taxpayer dollars on an investigation into an industry that is fully regulated by the FDA," Fabricant stated, adding that the attorney general had no legitimate data backing him up. "As the former head of the FDA's division of dietary supplement programs, I have seen firsthand how the agency may take swift and forceful action when dietary supplement companies violate federal regulations. The FDA is properly equipped to identify and go after firms that pose a threat to public health. Attorney general Schneiderman's claims that the FDA doesn't have ample authority in this area show a complete misunderstanding of the regulatory structure in place to protect consumers and remove products from the market."

However, despite this criticism, Fabricant has joined ranks with Schneiderman to improve the supplements industry and protect consumers.

In a joint statement issued last month, both expressed their solidarity: "We share a common objective of ensuring herbal products bought by consumers are authentic, pure and sold in full compliance with consumer protection laws. Anyone who buys an herbal supplement should be able to do so with full knowledge of what is in the product and have complete confidence that every precaution was taken to ensure its authenticity and purity. While no single test or technology alone can provide complete confidence to consumers, we support the application of DNA barcoding technology as part of a multifaceted approach to assuring authenticity and identifying substitution.

Wal-Mart Stores East to Pay $75,000 to Settle EEOC National Origin / Religious Harassment and Retaliation Lawsuit

Retailing Giant Intimidated and Humiliated Employee Who Complained About Harassment, Federal Agency Said

BALTIMORE - The eastern division of the nation's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores East, LP, will pay $75,000 and furnish significant equitable relief to resolve a national origin and religious harassment and retaliation lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency announced today.

The EEOC charged that an asset protection coordinator, Ebrima Jallow, who is Gambian and Muslim, was harassed by the store manager at the Walmart store in Landover Hills, Md. The store manager frequently made offensive comments about Jallow's national origin and religion, including telling Jallow that he should "go back to Africa," mocking his accent, and saying that "all Muslims do is blow up buildings and people," the EEOC said in its lawsuit.

The EEOC also charged that after Jallow complained about the harassment of himself and other employees and participated in investigations of discrimination, the store manager unlawfully retaliated against him, including threatening him with termination, placing him on a one-year "coaching period" and telling other employees not to cooperate with Jallow in the performance of his asset protection coordinator job duties.

Such conduct violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits harassment based on national origin or religion. Title VII also forbids employers from retaliating against employees who oppose harassment or discrimination. The EEOC filed suit (EEOC v. Wal-Mart Stores East, LP, Civil Action No. 8:13-cv-02655) in U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.

In addition to the $75,000 in monetary relief to Jallow, the 30-month consent decree resolving the lawsuit enjoins Wal-Mart Stores East, LP from any future discriminating on the basis of national origin or religion or engaging in unlawful retaliation. The company will provide training on federal laws and store policies prohibiting discrimination, harassment and retaliation to managers and human resources managers at the Walmart store where the alleged discrimination occurred. Wal-Mart East, LP will report to the EEOC regarding any internal complaints of alleged national origin discrimination, religious discrimination or retaliation and will post a notice regarding the settlement.

"Retaliation is the leading basis for charges filed with the EEOC," said EEOC Philadelphia District Director Spencer H. Lewis, Jr. "This settlement should remind all employers that if an employee complains about unlawful harassment or discrimination, the best course of action is to investigate promptly, stop any improper conduct and ensure that there is no unlawful reprisal against employees who exercise their civil rights."

EEOC Regional Attorney Debra M. Lawrence added, "Harassment based on national origin or religion simply has no business in the 21st century workplace. The EEOC is pleased that this settlement will provide equitable relief and training to prevent unlawful harassment, discrimination or retaliation."

The EEOC's Philadelphia District Office has jurisdiction over Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia and parts of New Jersey and Ohio. The legal staff of the EEOC Philadelphia District Office also prosecutes discrimination cases arising from Washington, D.C., and parts of Virginia.

The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the agency is available at its website, www.eeoc.gov .

Companies ease up a bit on worker dress codes

Wal-Mart employees were recently told the giant retailer would be easing up on its dress code. A bit.

In addition to khaki or black pants, Wal-Mart employees will now be able to add black- or khaki-colored denim pants to their work wardrobe. While employees still have to wear blue or white collared shirts and Wal-Mart vests, those who work more physically demanding jobs will be able to wear blue jeans and T-shirts. And the company will have "associate engagement days" where workers can wear items such as sport jerseys. (The choices!)

The decision is an example of what retail consultants see as a broader easing up, even if a mild one, by employers on the dress codes of front-line workers. "Retailers and employers are becoming more accommodative," said Burt Flickinger, managing director of the consulting firm Strategic Resource Group. "The trend is definitely evolving toward more casual."

Wal-Mart's dress code change, combined with other moves to adjust the thermostat and change up the music piped in the retail behemoth's stores, is also an example of an increased focus on "soft benefits" for front-line workers, according to retail consultant Neil Stern. As the economy improves and the job market heats up, more employers are looking for ways to keep their employees from jumping ship for other jobs.

"When you start to compete for workers, there's both hard and soft benefits," said Stern, a senior partner at McMillan Doolittle. "The hard benefits are what I am going to pay you. But people are also paying attention to all the other quality-of-workplace environmental issues that go along with it."

He also says more companies are relaxing policies to cater to millennial-age employees. While the struggle between young people and dress codes may seem like a long-running phenomenon, the size of this generation, as well as their much-researched desire to work for companies that align with their values, has many businesses rethinking their policies.

"I have a great picture in one of my presentations of a Whole Foods worker tattooed and with many earrings," Stern said. "If you don't allow them to have some freedom, they're not going to work for you."

Some are making the mild adjustments to attract young workers. The retailer PetSmart changed its dress code last year to allow "appropriate" visible tattoos (not containing profanity or nudity), as well as a minimum amount of jewelry and piercings. In October, Starbucks also relaxed its tattoo policy, as well as started allowing small nose studs, larger earlobe piercings, black denim, untucked shirts and personalized name badges. "We want to build a company where self-expression, empowerment and inclusion are nurtured," a company executive said a letter to employees.

Others are making the adjustments for different reasons, such as to reflect a new strategy or new corporate management. That was likely the case at Abercrombie & Fitch. In April, following a leadership change, the preppy-chic retailer softened its notoriously intense guidelines, saying workers now simply needed to be "neat, clean, natural and well-groomed." Before, the comprehensive policy had specific restrictions even on hair color ("sunkissed" was okay; "chunks of contrasting" color were not) and fingernails (no long nails or colored polish).

Its old dress code made news both for how restrictive it was and for the legal woes it caused the company. On Monday, even, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Muslim woman who said she had been denied a job at the retailer because she wore a head scarf. (Abercrombie said in a statement that the court didn't determine it had discriminated against the woman and that the company was deciding its next steps.)

Still, some company dress codes remain very particular, and some employers have loosened standards only to tighten them again. The Huffington Post recently reported on the dress code for the sandwich chain Jimmy John's — it stipulates no high-top sneakers, no dress shoes that don't have black or brown soles, and no jeans with "excessive stitching" on the rear.

The company's guide includes photos of exactly what shade of khaki pants are acceptable for its sandwich makers and delivery drivers (with big red Xs on those that are either too light or too brown) and says workers may wear only one "cause bracelet," noting it must be "professionally made, for an approved national cause, must be no wider than ½ inch, must be all one color, and must be the 'rubber' style." The company did not have a comment on the policy.

Department store J.C. Penney, meanwhile, has since brought back some degree of formality to its dress code, after former CEO Ron Johnson relaxed it in his wide-ranging efforts to overhaul the company. Liz Dunn, founder of retail consultancy Talmage Advisors, said that under Johnson "it was really difficult to see who even worked there. You can't go too far with it. It's important to let people have some freedom of expression, but at the basic, basic level, people need to be able to identify that you work there."

While the twin goals of identify workers and conveying a brand image will always be engrained in the concept of a corporate dress code, there are some signs that consumers — in addition to employers — are increasingly okay with scaling back its rigor.

The loosening of dress codes "is related, at its core, to changing consumer impressions of what a professional person looks like," Dunn said. "People don't have as many hangups as they used to about tattoos or beards or different religions. There are changing consumer norms, and that's being reflected."

Justices to review Tyson Foods appeal over class-action suit

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court agreed Monday to weigh new limits on the ability of workers to band together to dispute pay and workplace issues.

The justices said they will review a $5.8 million class-action judgment against Tyson Foods Inc. over the pay for more than 3,000 workers at its Storm Lake, Iowa, pork processing plant.

The case could allow the high court to elaborate on its 2011 decision blocking a massive sex-discrimination case against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. that would have included up to 1.6 million female workers.

Tyson, the Springdale, Arkansas-based company, said it should not have been forced to defend a class-action lawsuit that claims it failed to pay thousands of "knife-wielding" employees and others for time spent putting on and taking off protective work clothes and equipment.

A federal appeals court in St. Louis ruled 2-1 for the employees, who worked on the slaughter or "kill" floor and on the processing or "fabrication" floor.

Tyson argues that lower courts should not have allowed statistics to determine damages for the entire class based on average times observed in a sample of workers from the class. The company calls that a "trial-by-formula" that the high court rejected in the Wal-Mart case.

The company also says the lower courts improperly allowed the class to include hundreds of members who were not injured and would receive no damages in an individual lawsuit.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs say courts have used "representative proof" to allow class actions to go forward for nearly 70 years.

Tyson has faced similar litigation around the country. In 2010, it settled a decade-long dispute with the U.S. Department of Labor by agreeing to pay workers at some poultry plants for time they spent putting on and taking off protective clothing.

The case, Tyson Foods v. Bouaphakeo, 14-1146, will be argued when the court's new term begins in the fall.

Supreme Court to weigh new limits on class actions in appeal from Tyson Foods

WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Monday to weigh new limits on the ability of workers to band together to dispute pay and workplace issues.

The justices said they will review a $5.8 million class-action judgment against Tyson Foods Inc. over the pay for more than 3,000 workers at its Storm Lake, Iowa, pork processing plant.

The case could allow the high court to elaborate on its 2011 decision blocking a massive sex-discrimination case against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. that would have included up to 1.6 million female workers.

Tyson, the Springdale, Arkansas-based company, said it should not have been forced to defend a class-action lawsuit that claims it failed to pay thousands of "knife-wielding'' employees and others for time spent putting on and taking off protective work clothes and equipment.

A federal appeals court in St. Louis ruled 2-1 for the employees, who worked on the slaughter or "kill'' floor and on the processing or "fabrication'' floor.

Tyson argues that lower courts should not have allowed statistics to determine damages for the entire class based on average times observed in a sample of workers from the class. The company calls that a "trial-by-formula'' that the high court rejected in the Wal-Mart case.

The company also says the lower courts improperly allowed the class to include hundreds of members who were not injured and would receive no damages in an individual lawsuit.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs say courts have used "representative proof'' to allow class actions to go forward for nearly 70 years.

Tyson has faced similar litigation around the country. In 2010, it settled a decade-long dispute with the U.S. Department of Labor by agreeing to pay workers at some poultry plants for time they spent putting on and taking off protective clothing.

AP analysis: More 'phony numbers' in reports as stocks rise

NEW YORK (AP) — Those record profits that companies are reporting may not be all they're cracked up to be.

As the stock market climbs ever higher, professional investors are warning that companies are presenting misleading versions of their results that ignore a wide variety of normal costs of running a business to make it seem like they're doing better than they really are.

What's worse, the financial analysts who are supposed to fight corporate spin are often playing along. Instead of challenging the companies, they're largely passing along the rosy numbers in reports recommending stocks to investors.

Apple wants a lead role in streaming music

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple's iTunes helped change the way music-lovers bought their favorite songs, replacing plastic discs with digital downloads. Now the maker of iPods and iPhones wants to carve out a leading role in a revolution well under way, with a new, paid streaming-music service set to launch this summer.

With millions of listeners already tuning in to streaming outlets like Pandora and Spotify, analysts and music-industry sources say Apple has been gearing up to launch its own service, aimed at winning back some of those customers and nudging longtime iTunes users into a new mode of listening.

American Pharoah owners racing to capitalize on champ's name

NEW YORK (AP) — American Pharoah's owners and thoroughbred racing now have a new race to run: a race to capitalize on the horse's Triple Crown victory before the excitement fades away.

As the first winner of the sport's Triple Crown in 37 years, American Pharoah has a wealth of marketing opportunities that could never have been imagined by owners of the last winner, Affirmed, in 1978. At the same time, horse racing has declined into a niche pastime that is facing an aging demographic, a shrinking number of race tracks, and competition from new ways of betting on sports.

Survey: Slow 2nd quarter to drag on 2015 economic growth

U.S. economic growth in the second quarter will be far weaker than previously expected and it will prevent the pace of growth from exceeding last year's 2.4 percent, according to a forecast by a group of U.S. business economists.

Growth is expected to accelerate significantly in the third quarter, but "sluggish" conditions in the first three months of the year will persist into the second quarter and drag down average growth for the year, a survey by the National Association for Business Economists said Monday.

G-7 set far-off goal to move away from fossil fuels

ELMAU, Germany (AP) — The world should move away from using fossil fuels by the end of this century, G-7 leaders said Monday, setting an ambitious but distant goal ahead of a global conference on climate change this year.

The leaders of seven wealthy democracies also warned Russia that sanctions imposed for its actions against Ukraine would remain until a cease-fire is fully observed in eastern Ukraine — and those sanctions could be made tougher if the situation requires.

NEW YORK (AP) — Sears' first-quarter loss narrowed but sales continue to slump as the retailer prepares the rollout of its real-estate investment trust this week to raise cash.

Sears Holdings Corp., which operates Sears and Kmart stores, said that it expects the real estate investment trust that it is forming, Seritage Growth Properties, will be declared effective by the Securities & Exchange Commission this week.

FDA weighs target population for Amgen cholesterol drug

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal health regulators said Monday a highly-anticipated, experimental drug from Amgen significantly lowers bad cholesterol. But officials have questions about who should take the drug and whether to approve it based on currently available data.

The Food and Drug Administration posted its review of Amgen's Repatha ahead of a public meeting to consider its approval. Repatha is the part of a new class of injectable, cholesterol-lowing drugs that work differently than older, statin drugs. The new drugs are considered the first major advance in lowering bad, or LDL, cholesterol in more than 20 years, and analysts expect them to generate billions in sales.

Gov't plans to erase student debt for Corinthian students

WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal government will erase much of the debt of students who attended the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges, officials announced Monday, as part of a new plan that could cost taxpayers as much as $3.6 billion.

Corinthian Colleges was one of the largest for-profit schools when it nearly collapsed last year and became a symbol of fraud in the world of higher education and student loans. According to investigators, Corinthian schools charged exorbitant fees, lied about job prospects for its graduates and, in some cases, encouraged students to lie about their circumstances to get more federal aid.

Deutsche Bank shares soar on planned leadership change

BERLIN (AP) — Shares in Deutsche Bank soared Monday, a day after the company said its co-CEOs, Anshu Jain and Juergen Fitschen, will step down early.

The bank's shares were up 5.1 percent in afternoon trading in Frankfurt at 29.02 euros — by far the biggest gainer on the DAX index of leading German shares, which was off 0.7 percent.

The rise follows Sunday's statement from Germany's biggest bank that Jain, 52, will depart at the end of this month while Fitschen, 66, will follow next May. Their successor will be British banker John Cryan, initially as co-CEO with Fitschen and then in sole charge. Cryan, 54, is currently a member of the company's supervisory board.

Shares of Humana rally on silence and a withdrawal

Humana has pulled out of a major health care conference and said it will not comment on rumors of a merger, actions that will likely fuel Wall Street speculation that the insurer is part of a developing deal.

Shares of the Medicare Advantage coverage provider, which hit an all-time high late last month, rose Monday while broader indexes slipped.

Humana said that it has received analyst and investor questions about its outlook and the possibility that it will "participate in industry consolidation." The insurer said that as part of a long-standing policy it won't comment on speculation and that it will observe a quiet period that lasts until it announces second-quarter results July 29.

Last-minute rush as deadline nears for oil spill settlement

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — People seeking money for losses from the 2010 BP oil spill rushed to file claims online or lined up outside Gulf Coast claims offices Monday as a midnight filing deadline loomed.

Claims are being filed for compensation under the terms of a 2012 settlement that plaintiffs' lawyers struck with BP.

Patrick Juneau, the attorney appointed by a federal court to oversee the claims process, said there was a "substantial increase" in filings Monday. He said it would take days to arrive at a final figure, noting that claims also were being filed by mail and would be accepted as long as they were postmarked June 8.

Obama leads calls for Greece to secure deal swiftly

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece faced acute international pressure, notably from President Barack Obama, to secure a deal with creditors fast following days of acrimony that stoked fears of a Greek debt default and exit from the euro.

With Greece facing an end-of-month deadline to secure a deal, Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel led calls Monday for a swift resolution to Greece's protracted bailout talks.

At the end of a G-7 summit in Elmau, Germany, Obama said there was a "sense of urgency" to resolve the situation.

To Win, Walmart Tries Warming Up To Its Own

Walmart's annual shareholder meeting is always an elaborate performance for investors and shareholders, and in many ways, this year's days-long production doesn't seem to have been much different. There were the usual celebrity hijinks, for example, including actress Reese Witherspoon as MC, performances by Rod Stewart and Mariah Carey, and an appearance by comedian Carol Burnett.

But in keeping with its recent campaign, and promise of $1 billion, to convince its employees that it doesn't deserve to be the world's most hated retailer, executives tried to put its 2 million associates center stage.

"With hard work and determination, you can exceed your highest expectations here," President and CEO Doug McMillon says, in remarks prepared for the event. "I'm so proud of the work we've done this year to demonstrate how we've always felt about our own associates, our team."

He compared them to superheros. "We do have super powers. They're our passion, our commitment to our customers, our caring for one another. Really, our superpowers are those that help us make someone's day better; their life better."

The company has been roundly vilified for its low wages, difficult working conditions, and discriminatory practices, and it seems to be recognizing that changing that image is essential if it wants to recover its growth mojo. With promises to relax the dress code, allow associates to change the temperature in their stores, higher wages for its 100,000 managers, and new badges that say "Our people make the difference," Walmart is hoping associates can help solve its central problem: Stubbornly slow sales at its supercenters. And its 2 million associates can change that, he says, "one customer at a time."

He also told attendees the Bentonville, Ark.-based company needs to more work faster "and stop talking about digital and physical retail as if they're two separate things. The customer doesn't think of it that way, and we can't either. Customers just want us to solve their everyday problems with an easy, seamless shopping experience."

In a Q&A session that was also webcast, he told analysts the company knows that it needs to innovate faster. "We are very aware that this is a 52-year-old business that drove a lot of volume with supercenters, and you'll see us do more tinkering to learn, so that we'll be comfortable with failing — on the appropriate scale and not too often," he says.

E-commerce continues to be its biggest avenue to growth. "Every time we introduce a new service we're asked if we are finding new customers or just deepening our relationship with existing customers, and invariably, it is both," says Neil M. Ashe, president and CEO of its e-commerce division.

Shareholders also elected Greg Penner, 45, as the company's new chairman, succeeding Rob Walton, 70, who has been chairman for 23 years. Penner is Rob Walton's son-in-law, and the news is disappointing to shareholders who had hoped to elect a chair that was independent of the Waltons. While Walton family members own some 51% of the company stock, many investors, including some large pension funds, believe that following its bribery scandal in Mexico several years ago, the chain needs stricter oversight.

A Walmart worker is suing the retail giant for alleged discrimination after she refused to work Sundays so she could go to church.

Cory Chavis, 40, says she was forced to use her vacation days on Sundays for six months until the Rockland County Walmart where she worked finally accommodated her, according to the Manhattan federal court suit.

"Shortly after Chavis received this accommodation, Chavis' managers began to investigate her in an attempt to find cause to discipline her and terminate her employment," said the suit, which claims that prior to the dispute, she always received "solid" evaluations.

Walmart did not respond to a request for comment.

Supreme Court To Decide Whether To Hear Four High-Stakes Cases Asking When A Suit May Be Litigated As A Class Action

The Supreme Court will decide before the end of this Term whether to hear any or all of four important cases that raise recurring questions of class action law that have sharply divided the lower courts. These cases address questions that we have blogged about before (e.g., here and here): whether a class full of uninjured members may be certified, and whether plaintiffs may rely on experts and statistics to gloss over individualized differences among class members in order to prove their class claims and damages. These questions strike at the heart of what it means to be a "class," because class actions generally must be litigated using common evidence to show that each class member has been harmed.

The Supreme Court's seminal decisions in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes (2011) and Comcast Corp. v. Behrend (2013) seemed to resolve these legal issues. Dukes decertified a nationwide class of employees raising gender discrimination claims and held that plaintiffs seeking to represent a class must "demonstrate that the class members 'have suffered the same injury'" by proving their claims that must be "capable of classwide resolution ... in one stroke." The Dukes Court also disapproved of "trials by formula," in which liability is determined for a "sample set" of class members and then "applied to the entire remaining class." And in Comcast, the Court overturned a class certification order in an antitrust case because plaintiffs' statistical model fell "far short of establishing that damages are capable of measurement on a classwide basis."

Some lower courts have read Dukes  and Comcast to shut the door to class actions in which plaintiffs cannot establish classwide liability with common evidence, but others continue to allow plaintiffs to represent classes full of uninjured members. In 2013, defendants asked the Supreme Court to review Sixth and Seventh Circuits decisions that allowed a handful of plaintiffs who alleged that their washing machines produced musty odors to represent buyers of scores of different washing machines, even though only a small portion of buyers ever complained about odors, most purchasers were satisfied with their machines, and use and care habits varied across the classes and affected the conditions of users' machines. After an initial GVR the Court ultimately declined to hear those cases, and these important legal issues have now percolated in the lower courts for two more years, leading to the certification of many dubious classes.

Four cert petitions now ask the Court to pick up where it left off in Dukes and Comcast and further flesh out the limits of when a case may be litigated as a class action. In a massive antitrust case, Dow Chemical is seeking review of a Tenth Circuit decision (pdf) that affirmed a $1.1 billion judgment to a class of purchasers of polyurethane chemicals. Plaintiffs alleged that Dow conspired with other polyurethane manufactures to issue coordinated price announcements—not actual price increases—but the evidence at trial showed that individual purchasers robustly negotiated prices with individual suppliers, that many purchasers switched to lower-cost suppliers of the chemicals, and that other purchasers simply refused to pay announced price increases. The Tenth Circuit swept those individualized issues under the rug by presuming that price announcements actually increased prices to all purchasers, a presumption that the Supreme Court has called "unreasonable" in a controlling antitrust decision.

Cert petitions in three employment cases are also knocking at the Court's door. Wal-Mart seeks review of a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision (pdf) that affirmed a $150 million judgment to a class of 187,000 current and former Wal-Mart employees alleging that Wal-Mart did not fully compensate them for rest breaks and off-the-clock work. The plaintiffs of course did not call 187,000 employees to testify at trial. They called a handful of plaintiffs and otherwise used statistical extrapolation of some employee time cards to prove injury to the class, depriving Wal-Mart of its right to challenge each individual class member's claim that he or she was not fully compensated.

Tyson Foods has asked the Court to review an Eighth Circuit decision (pdf) that affirmed a $6 million judgment to a class of workers alleging that Tyson did not fully pay them for time spent donning and doffing protective equipment. The evidence showed that protective equipment and walking times varied across the class, but the Eighth Circuit allowed plaintiffs to paper over those differences by modeling the time that it took the "average" employee to dress and walk to and from his work station—though most class members looked nothing like this hypothetical employee. Plaintiffs' controversial use of statistics fractured the Eighth Circuit. The panel split 2-1 in its decision, and the Eighth Circuit narrowly denied rehearing en banc by a 6-5 vote.

Finally, Allstate Insurance has asked the Court to review a blogged about previously. There, the Ninth Circuit allowed one claims adjuster to represent a class of all California claims adjusters alleging that Allstate has an unofficial policy of pressuring adjusters to work uncompensated hours. The lower courts' apparent trial plan is to allow the plaintiff class to prove three issues that would not resolve liability for even one class member and then to push all individualized defenses and damages issues to nebulous, to-be-determined individual hearings that the district court will describe more fully at some later date.

Predicting which cases the Supreme Court will hear is always difficult, but chances seem good that the Court will grant certiorari in one or more of these cases. The Dow, Wal-Mart, and Tyson petitions are unusual in that these cases all were tried, reached final judgments, and have fully developed records. Because class certification puts tremendous pressure on defendants to settle, very few class actions are litigated to final judgment. The cert petitions the Court sees in class actions typically challenge interlocutory rulings upholding class-certification orders; plaintiffs oppose those petitions by arguing that any harm is speculative and any errors can be corrected by the district courts as the case proceeds. The plaintiffs in Dow, Wal-Mart, and Tyson cannot not offer those arguments. The full trial records allow the Court to see exactly the effects that class certification has on the defendants' ability to mount a defense at trial; no speculation is required.

Given the staggering judgments in Dow and the most recent Wal-Mart case, there will be even more pressure on defendants to settle future cases after orders granting class certification. If the Court doesn't step in soon to clarify to the lower courts that it meant what it said in its decisions in Dukes and Comcast, defendants will be even more likely to throw in the towel rather than risk another nine- or ten-figure jury verdict. The cert petitions in these cases present the Court with an extraordinary opportunity to review class-certification orders in cases with fully developed trial records, one that may not come around again given the behavior of many lower courts now.

Numerous friend-of-the-court briefs have asked the Supreme Court to hear these cases, signaling their importance. The Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable, National Association of Manufacturers, Product Liability Advisory Council, prominent economists, and many other concerned organizations have highlighted the broad impact that these cases have on class-action litigation and discuss the significant toll that class actions take on our economy. And John Engler, the former governor of Michigan and now president of Business Roundtable, urged the Supreme Court to review these cases because of their importance to American business in a recent op ed in the Washington Times.

These four petitions show that, despite the Supreme Court's decisions in Dukes and Comcast, courts continue to certify large classes that are so disparate that a defendant cannot conceivably offer a full defense within the class-trial format, which prevents close individual inquiry into each class member's circumstances. We would not be surprised if the Court decides to hear some or all of these cases and then issues decisions that will have lasting impact on class-action law.

Fourth Circuit Orders Class Certification for African-American Steelworkers—Again

For the second time, the Fourth Circuit has determined that African-American employees at a South Carolina steel plant are entitled to Rule 23 class certification. In Brown v. Nucor Corporation and Nucor Steel-Berkeley, Plaintiffs originally sought class certification for alleged discriminatory job promotion practices and a racially hostile work environment in their suit against Nucor Corporation and Nucor Steel-Berkeley, operators of a steel plant in Huger, South Carolina, where putative class members worked across multiple departments. In 2007, the United States District Court in Charleston, South Carolina, denied plaintiffs' motion for class certification.

 The Fourth Circuit reversed the ruling in 2009, vacating and remanding the case with instructions to the District Court to certify the class as to both claims.

After the U. S. Supreme Court issued its Wal-Mart v. Dukes opinion in 2011 (holding that Rule 23 class certification was not appropriate for Wal-Mart employees in different store locations and under different managers), , the Nucor District Court decertified the class of steelworkers with regard to the job promotions claim but not the hostile work environment claim. The District Court held that the plaintiffs failed to present a common issue of discrimination in light of the discretionary and multi-layered decision-making structure.

Plaintiffs appealed the decertification, and the Fourth Circuit recently reinstated the job promotions class. The Fourth Circuit reasoned that the plant's promotions system "created an environment in which the discriminatory exercise of discretion by one department head harmed the promotions opportunities for all African-American workers at the plant by foreclosing on opportunities in that department and generally impeding upward mobility."  Therefore, the Appeals Court opined, the District Court had "fundamentally misapprehended the reach of Wal-Mart and its application to the workers' promotion class."

The Fourth Circuit's order reinstating the class distinguishes the instant case from Wal Mart v. Dukes on several grounds.  First, while the Wal-Mart plaintiffs failed to show discrimination on a store-by-store basis for a class that could have amounted to over a million employees, the instant class only has as many as 150, all in a single plant.  Second, the plaintiffs' statistical expert in Wal-Mart could not specifically determine how the allegedly pervasive gender-biased culture of Wal-Mart influenced individual employment decisions.  Here, the plaintiffs' statistical expert identified a statistically significant disparity in promotions of African-American workers.  Next, the Fourth Circuit reasoned that the anecdotal evidence in the instant case was "substantially more probative' than that in the Wal-Mart case. The Court reasoned that, even after Wal-Mart v. Dukes, a "pattern of discrimination, revealed through statistics and anecdotal evidence, can alone support a disparate treatment claim, even where the pattern is the result of discretionary decision-making.  To hold otherwise would dramatically undermine Title VII's prophylactic powers."

The Brown v. Nucor Corporation ruling indicates that Wal-Mart v. Dukes did not necessarily whittle down Title VII class actions to a single decision-maker or single department class.  If a class can identify a systemic practice—even something vague like the exercise of discretion—Rule 23 certification is plausible.

Can We Finally Treat Food Workers Fairly?

Two pieces of seemingly unrelated news last week show just how deficient our values are when it comes to the treatment of the lowest paid workers in our economy, the largest portion of whom are employed in the food chain.

First, Los Angeles followed Seattle and San Francisco in setting its minimum wage at $15 per hour. With New York looking as if it might join the club, $15 could become the new, de facto $7.25, the current federal minimum hourly wage. (As I’ve mentioned before, many tipped workers make even less than that.) A couple of days later, Walmart, among the worst offenders in the realm of labor abuse, announced that it would push its suppliers for improvements in ... animal welfare.

If Walmart’s new rules are enforced, they’d be stricter and more humane than any set by federal agencies. But the standards are voluntary, vague and without a deadline; and the company has a history of not following through on its promises.

And what does it say that you can buy a can of tuna guaranteed to be dolphin-safe but can’t guarantee that its human producers — fishers, processors, transporters, packers, sales representatives — haven’t been abused?

It’s difficult to cheer an announcement by a corporation whose labor- and farmer-crushing techniques are world renown. Walmart specializes — indeed, is the leader — in driving down supplier prices regardless of true costs and in under-employing workers for a variety of deplorable reasons, like avoiding paying benefits or providing health care, making it difficult to unionize and making overtime pay out of the question.

The world’s biggest food retailer and its ilk are a good part of the reason that our cities and states are stepping in and saying, quite simply, “Our workers deserve better.” Though Los Angeles’s new minimum is to be phased in over five years (that’s a long time to wait if you’re making $9 an hour right now), it will be linked to the Consumer Price Index in 2022, which means it could go even higher.

Yet Walmart insists that cost-cutting enables its “always low prices.” (The slogan could as well be “always disproportionately high profits.”) And opponents of a living wage will always break out the line that higher wages will close marginal businesses and therefore cost jobs.

But if you run a business that’s dependent on labor at the poverty level or worse, and that business doesn’t work if you pay workers something approaching a living wage, it isn’t a viable business, from either the moral or practical point of view. (I wish the moral argument were sufficient, and it says a lot about the wayward path of our country that it isn’t.) Practically: If the lowest-paid workers aren’t on the job, there is no business.

I visited a big central California farm a couple of weeks ago, with 50 workers in a single field. Their days looked something like this: repetitive manual labor for two hours, then a 15-minute break; that same labor for two hours, then a 30-minute lunch; repeat, then a break; repeat, then go home. For this they were paid $10 an hour, or roughly $80 a day. This is seasonal work, but even if it were year-round employment, that $400 a week translates to $20,800 a year, barely above the poverty level for a family of four — and it carries no benefits. Yet without those workers, the rest of us don’t eat salad.

This exploitative situation works great for the operation’s owners and for those of us with money. It reminded me that the plantation system of the Old South benefited its genteel owners and consumers of its products. But it was enabled by slavery, which wasn’t abolished simply because it was wrong, but because it wasn’t sustainable. Paying people less than a living wage is the 21st century version of this.

Slaves, it might be remembered, were actually dislocated by abolition. Few would argue against freedom, but systematic discrimination, homelessness and unemployment were not exactly painless consequences. Thus the fallout from slavery and its aftereffects are still felt today, the core of Ta-Nehisi Coates’s powerfully persuasive arguments for reparations.

When you look at who does the work in the food system, it is clear we have institutionalized racism, we exploit immigrants to do the work citizens won’t stoop to do, and we are as a society abiding the consequences of employers who underpay workers. These consequences will be felt for decades or even centuries in the form of an economy that features the further accumulation of wealth in a small fraction of society and a lack of socioeconomic mobility for almost everyone else. How much more money does the Walton family and their class need?

The mantras that raising the minimum wage is “bad for the economy” and “kills jobs and businesses” are gibberish. Report after report shows that higher wages throughout the system are a boost to the economy, not job killers. Higher wages are a stimulus, since low-paid people — unlike the rich — recirculate every dollar they earn, yielding a multiplier effect and supporting both local and national businesses.

There is no social contract or obligation to prop up businesses that pay starvation wages while shareholders become richer. In fact, the American proposition is that workers get the fair treatment their productivity merits and that we’d all expect were we in their place. Yet most workers are producing more and earning less, and the differential between those two elements is what’s enriching the Waltons and others like them.

It would be foolish to invest faith in capitalists leading the charge for better lives for laborers, but even Henry Ford famously doubled the minimum wage on his lines, recognizing that “unless an industry can so manage itself as to keep wages high and prices low it destroys itself, for otherwise it limits the number of its customers.”

Ford wanted his employees to buy his products; yet there are McDonald’s employees who can’t afford its food. (Or rent.) And that behemoth’s latest move, as it strives to become a “progressive burger company”? To buy back shares and give further profits to shareholders, rather than to raise wages throughout its system.

President Obama’s attempt to raise the federal minimum wage to a still-paltry $10.10 is stalled. Last month, McDonald’s magnanimously gave 90,000 of its workers a one-dollar raise. Yet this month, Los Angeles raised the minimum for almost a million people by $6.

That’s a direct consequence of the Fight for $15. Considered nearly ridiculous and certainly pie-in-the-sky just a year ago, this has become the most successful labor movement in the country, relying on demonstrating, organizing, striking and even publicly shaming those who belong in some Dickensian 19th-century netherworld. To reverse the decline in the status of workers, to bring about positive change in people’s lives, we’ll need to see more of that.

Nucor Race Bias Class Action Divides Fourth Circuit; FROM THE COURTS

In a sign that even four years later, courts are still grappling with the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Wal-Mart v. Dukes, a bitterly divided federal appeals court this week ordered the certification of a class of black steelworkers at Nucor Corp.

Ruling 2-1, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit concluded Monday that a South Carolina federal judge misread Wal-Mart when he decertified a class accusing Nucor of providing black employees with fewer promotions than their white counterparts.

Arnold & Porter's Lisa Blatt argued the appeal for Nucor, while Robert Wiggins Jr. of the Birmingham, Alabama-based Wiggins, Childs, Quinn & Pantazis argued for the employees.

The decision marks the second time the Fourth Circuit has sided with the employees on class certification issues in the case, which dates back to 2004. In 2009, in another 2-1 opinion, the appeals court reversed a ruling that had denied class status to the employees on both their promotion claims and a separate claim that Nucor maintained a racially hostile work environment. (Among other things, the plaintiffs allege that supervisors broadcast monkey noises and racist epithets like "bologna lips" and "yard ape" over a plantwide radio system.)

Following the first trip to the appeals court, U.S. District Judge C. Weston Houck in Charleston, South Carolina, revisited the class claims in light of the Supreme Court's 2011 decision in Wal-Mart, which decertified a massive, nationwide class of female employees making gender bias claims against the retailer. Houck concluded in September 2012 that under Wal-Mart, the Nucor workers could continue pursuing hostile work environment claims as a class, but not their promotion bias claims.

On Monday, the Fourth Circuit majority acknowledged that while Wal-Mart reshaped the landscape of class action litigation, it shouldn't have led to decertification in this case. In a 63-page opinion that explores the bounds of the Supreme Court's decision, the panel noted that there was both statistical and substantial anecdotal evidence that promotion decisions at Nucor's plant depended at least in part on an employee's race.

"The district court fundamentally misapprehended the reach of Wal-Mart and its application to the workers' promotions class," U.S. Circuit Judge Roger Gregory wrote for the panel.

As with the Fourth Circuit's 2009 class certification ruling, the panel that ruled Monday was divided, with U.S. Circuit Judge G. Steven Agee issuing a 90-page dissent that criticized the majority for undermining "well-established judicial processes," causing a rift with other circuit courts and draining Wal-Mart of its meaning.

"Perhaps the Supreme Court will act to rectify the problems that are sure to follow from today's opinion. One can only hope that it will do so soon," wrote Agee.

Gregory responded to the dissent at the close of his majority opinion, writing that Agee "rightly observes" that the majority conducted its analysis with the goal of reaching a desired result.

"And that result is simple justice," Gregory continued. "At bottom, the workers seek nothing more than the chance to speak with one voice about the promotions discrimination they allegedly suffered as one class on account of one uniting feature: the color of their skin. The dissent would deny them that chance."

One of Nucor's lawyers, Cary Farris of Alaniz Schraeder Linker Farris Mayes, declined to comment on Tuesday. Schraeder cited an order from the district judge that, she said, bars the parties from discussing the case publicly without permission. McGuireWoods is also representing Nucor in the case, alongside Alaniz Schraeder and Arnold & Porter.

Wiggins, the employees' lead lawyer on appeal, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Wiggins Childs is joined on the plaintiffs side by Derfner, Altman & Wilborn.

In a sign that even four years later, courts are still grappling with the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Wal-Mart v. Dukes, a bitterly divided federal appeals court this week ordered the certification of a class of black steelworkers at Nucor Corp.

Ruling 2-1, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit concluded Monday that a South Carolina federal judge misread Wal-Mart when he decertified a class accusing Nucor of providing black employees with fewer promotions than their white counterparts.

Arnold & Porter's Lisa Blatt argued the appeal for Nucor, while Robert Wiggins Jr. of the Birmingham, Alabama-based Wiggins, Childs, Quinn & Pantazis argued for the employees.

The decision marks the second time the Fourth Circuit has sided with the employees on class certification issues in the case, which dates back to 2004. In 2009, in another 2-1 opinion, the appeals court reversed a ruling that had denied class status to the employees on both their promotion claims and a separate claim that Nucor maintained a racially hostile work environment. (Among other things, the plaintiffs allege that supervisors broadcast monkey noises and racist epithets like "bologna lips" and "yard ape" over a plantwide radio system.)

Following the first trip to the appeals court, U.S. District Judge C. Weston Houck in Charleston, South Carolina, revisited the class claims in light of the Supreme Court's 2011 decision in Wal-Mart, which decertified a massive, nationwide class of female employees making gender bias claims against the retailer. Houck concluded in September 2012 that under Wal-Mart, the Nucor workers could continue pursuing hostile work environment claims as a class, but not their promotion bias claims.

On Monday, the Fourth Circuit majority acknowledged that while Wal-Mart reshaped the landscape of class action litigation, it shouldn't have led to decertification in this case. In a 63-page opinion that explores the bounds of the Supreme Court's decision, the panel noted that there was both statistical and substantial anecdotal evidence that promotion decisions at Nucor's plant depended at least in part on an employee's race.

"The district court fundamentally misapprehended the reach of Wal-Mart and its application to the workers' promotions class," U.S. Circuit Judge Roger Gregory wrote for the panel.

As with the Fourth Circuit's 2009 class certification ruling, the panel that ruled Monday was divided, with U.S. Circuit Judge G. Steven Agee issuing a 90-page dissent that criticized the majority for undermining "well-established judicial processes," causing a rift with other circuit courts and draining Wal-Mart of its meaning.

"Perhaps the Supreme Court will act to rectify the problems that are sure to follow from today's opinion. One can only hope that it will do so soon," wrote Agee.

Gregory responded to the dissent at the close of his majority opinion, writing that Agee "rightly observes" that the majority conducted its analysis with the goal of reaching a desired result.

"And that result is simple justice," Gregory continued. "At bottom, the workers seek nothing more than the chance to speak with one voice about the promotions discrimination they allegedly suffered as one class on account of one uniting feature: the color of their skin. The dissent would deny them that chance."

One of Nucor's lawyers, Cary Farris of Alaniz Schraeder Linker Farris Mayes, declined to comment on Tuesday. Schraeder cited an order from the district judge that, she said, bars the parties from discussing the case publicly without permission. McGuireWoods is also representing Nucor in the case, alongside Alaniz Schraeder and Arnold & Porter.

Wiggins, the employees' lead lawyer on appeal, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Wiggins Childs is joined on the plaintiffs side by Derfner, Altman & Wilborn.
