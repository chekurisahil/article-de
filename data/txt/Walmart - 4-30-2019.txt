? Votes urged on salary and harassment checks

? Critic Sanders to attend annual meeting

Walmart is facing calls to shake up its executive pay, boardroom composition and approach to workplace sexual harassment at the US retailer's annual meeting, which is expected to be gatecrashed by presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.

Two influential shareholder advisory groups are recommending votes against the world's biggest retailer at the Arkansas gathering next week, according to people close to the situation.

Glass Lewis has advised investors to vote against Walmart's remuneration plans, citing a "pay and performance disconnect". Institutional Shareholder Services has backed the pay plan but thrown its weight behind an investor motion that demands that Walmart strengthens board oversight to prevent workplace sexual harassment.

The proxy recommendations threaten to add institutional shareholder heft to political and activist scrutiny of Walmart. Mr Sanders, the leftwing Vermont senator who has put Walmart at the centre of his campaign to strengthen worker rights, is to demand employees are represented on its board.

Walmart, which employs about 2.2m people globally, gave the average worker a pay rise last year of less than 3 per cent to $21,952, while chief executive Doug McMillon's total pay package last year rose 3.6 per cent to $23.6m.

Walmart said that its pay plans were designed to motivate and retain top executives "with the ultimate goal of generating strong operating results", adding that a majority of their remuneration was performance-based. Glass Lewis, however, noted total shareholder returns last year fell 8 per cent and said that it did not believe Walmart's scheme "sufficiently aligns pay with performance". In particular, it criticised the company's long-term incentive plan.

Under the "performance equity" part of the plan, executives are awarded shares based on a one-year performance period. Glass Lewis said that "an overwhelming majority of firms with comparable size and scope use multiyear goals in the face of many similar challenges".

Mr Sanders, a longtime critic of Walmart, argues that employee representation on the board would rein in executive pay as well as improve conditions for workers. Walmart said that it hoped Mr Sanders would treat his appearance at the meeting "not as a campaign stop, but as a constructive opportunity to learn" of the opportunities Walmart created for workers.

Walmart, pressed for $ 24 million salary to CEO

Walmart faces calls for a restructuring of executive salaries, composition of the board of directors and focus on sexual harassment in the workplace at the retailer's annual meeting, which is expected that presidential candidate Bernie Sanders participates.

Two influential shareholder advisory groups recommend voting against the world's largest retail group at the meeting in Arkansas next week, according to people close to the situation.

Glass Lewis advised investors to vote against Walmart's compensation plans, citing a "disconnect between pay and performance." Doug McMillon, the executive director, was given a compensation package of 23.6 million dollars last year.

Institutional Shareholder Services supported the compensation plan, but put its weight behind an investor motion that requires Walmart to strengthen oversight of the board of directors to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace.

The recommendations of power threaten to add the weight of the institutional shareholders to the political scrutiny and activists on Walmart. Sanders, the left senator from Vermont who placed Walmart at the center of his campaign to strengthen workers' rights, is preparing to demand that employees be represented on its board of directors.

Walmart, which employs about 2.2 million people worldwide, gave the average worker a salary increase last year of less than 3 percent. The average employee received $ 21,952 in the year through the end of January, compared to $ 19,177 the previous year.

McMillon received about a thousand times more. Its total package, which includes salary, performance bonuses and other benefits, rose 3.6 percent.

Judith McKenna, the former Asda executive who was promoted last year to head Walmart's international operation, received a package of 12.9 million dollars.

Asda-owner in hot water over executive pay

THE US owner of Asda is facing pressure to make changes to its executive pay and sexual harassment policy, as two proxy advisers recommended shareholders vote against the company at its annual meeting next week. Glass Lewis has recommended that shareholders vote against Walmart's executive pay proposals, saying "overall, the company paid more than its peers, but performed worse than its peers".

Walmart chief executive Doug McMillon took home a $23.6m (£18.6m) pay packet last year.

Meanwhile, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) said investors at the meeting in Arkansas should back a shareholder proposal to strengthen the firm's policy around sexual harassment in the workplace.

ISS said a vote for the proposal, which is opposed by Walmart's board, could "help shareholders better assess the company's management of related risks".

"The proponents say that workplace sexual harassment can damage a company's reputation and affect its share value, and is correlated with higher turnover and less employee productivity," the advisory note added.

Bernie Sanders, a US Democratic presidential candidate and senator, is planning to attend the annual meeting to push for higher wages for Walmart employees.

"Walmart workers are sick and tired of being paid poverty wages, while the Walton family is worth over $170bn," Sanders said on Twitter.

"I'm honoured to have been invited by Walmart workers to demand they have a seat on the company's board."

McMillon's pay is 1,076 times the amount earned by the average Walmart worker, who collects around $14.26 an hour.

Two influential shareholder advisory groups are recommending votes against the world's biggest retailer at the Arkansas gathering next week, according to people close to the situation.

Glass Lewis has advised investors to vote against Walmart's remuneration plans, citing a "pay and performance disconnect". Doug McMillon, chief executive, was handed a $23.6 million (€21 million) package for last year.

Walmart, which employs about 2.2 million people globally, gave the average worker a pay rise last year of less than 3 per cent.

The median employee received $21,952 (€19,612) in the year to the end of January, up from $19,177 the previous year. Mr McMillon's total package rose 3.6 per cent.

Walmart, which has a $294 billion market capitalisation, generated operating income of $22 billion last year on revenues that rose 2.8 per cent to $515 billion. Ecommerce sales rose 40 per cent.

Votes recommended against retailer on remuneration and sexual harassment oversight

Walmart is facing calls to shake up its executive pay, boardroom composition and approach to workplace sexual harassment at the US retailer’s annual meeting, expected to be gatecrashed by presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.

Two influential shareholder advisory groups are recommending votes against the world’s biggest retailer at the Arkansas gathering next week, according to people close to the situation.

Glass Lewis has advised investors to vote against Walmart’s remuneration plans, citing a “pay and performance disconnect”. Doug McMillon, chief executive, was handed a $23.6m package for last year.

Institutional Shareholder Services has backed the pay plan but thrown its weight behind an investor motion that demands Walmart strengthen board oversight to prevent workplace sexual harassment.

The proxy recommendations threaten to add institutional shareholder heft to political and activist scrutiny of Walmart. Mr Sanders, the leftwing Vermont senator who has put Walmart at the centre of his campaign to strengthen worker rights, is to demand that employees are represented on its board.

Walmart, which employs about 2.2m people globally, gave the average worker a pay rise last year of 14.5 per cent. The median employee received $21,952 in the year to the end of January, up from $19,177 the previous year.

Mr McMillon received about 1,000 times more. His total package, including salary, performance-dependent bonuses and other benefits, rose 3.6 per cent.

Judith McKenna, the former Asda executive promoted to run Walmart’s international business last year, received a $12.9m package. US division chief Greg Foran picked up $13.5m, chief financial officer Brett Biggs $9.4m and Sam’s Club head John Furner $9.3m.

Walmart, which has a $294bn market capitalisation, said its pay plans were designed to motivate and retain top executives “with the ultimate goal of generating strong operating results”. The company said a substantial majority of their remuneration was performance-based, reflecting a “pay-for-performance culture”.

The retailer generated operating income of $22bn last year on revenues that rose 2.8 per cent to $515bn. Ecommerce sales rose 40 per cent.

Glass Lewis, however, noted total shareholder returns last year fell 8 per cent and said it did not believe Walmart’s scheme “sufficiently aligns pay with performance”. In particular, it criticised the company’s long-term incentive plan.

Under the “performance equity” part of the plan, executives are awarded shares based on a one-year performance period. Glass Lewis said “an overwhelming majority of firms with comparable size and scope use multiyear goals in the face of many similar challenges”.

Walmart defended the plan’s design, pointing out that the shares still vested over a three-year period. Its approach balanced “long-term focus with clear and understandable performance goals”.

Mr Sanders, a longtime critic of Walmart and the Walton family descendants of its founders, argues that employee representation on the board would rein in executive pay as well as improve conditions for workers.

The company said in a statement that it hoped Mr Sanders would treat his appearance at the meeting “not as a campaign stop, but as a constructive opportunity to learn” about the opportunities Walmart created for workers.

The scale of any shareholder rebellion on executive pay was unclear ahead of the meeting. Glass Lewis also recommended investors vote against Walmart’s executive pay last year, when 9.4 per cent of votes cast failed to back the company.

ISS is supporting United for Respect, which represents retail workers, in its demand that Walmart compile a report reviewing how it deals with sexual harassment allegations. The advisory group, which is backing similar shareholder motions at Amazon and XPO Logistics, said it would help investors “better gauge” the risk of reputation-damaging scandals.

Walmart said it already had a strong anti-harassment policy in place, adding that such a review would be unnecessary and a distraction. Glass Lewis said it had “significant reservations” about the motion and recommended shareholders vote against it.

This article has been amended to correct the percentage increase of median pay at Walmart.

Bernie Sanders to demand Walmart raise 'poverty wages'

US Democratic candidate will gatecrash the retailer’s annual meeting in Arkansas in June

Bernie Sanders, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, is preparing to gatecrash Walmart’s annual meeting to demand the world’s biggest retailer increase its 2.2 million workers “poverty wages”.

Sanders is expected to attack the multi-billionaire Walton family, who own Walmart, for paying its full-time workers an average of just $14.26 per hour (£11.25) while handing the chief executive, Doug McMillon, a $23.6m pay package.

McMillon’s pay is 1,076 times that collected by the median worker, and makes him by far the best paid person in Arkansas, where Walmart is based and where the AGM will be held.

“Walmart workers are sick and tired of being paid poverty wages, while the Walton family is worth over $170bn,” the Vermont senator said in a tweet. “I’m honored to have been invited by Walmart workers to demand they have a seat on the company’s board.”

Sanders, a longtime critic of working conditions at the nation’s biggest private employer, will introduce the workers proposal at the annual meeting in Rogers, Arkansas, on 5 June. However, there is very little chance of the proposal attracting enough votes.

Sanders will speak as a proxy for Cat Davis, a Walmart employee who filed the latest action. “We should have the power to decide what happens at the company many of us have given our working lives to,” Davis said in a statement. “Associates deserve more from Walmart than we’re getting right now, especially as we’re the ones who create the company’s profits. Senator Sanders recognises that.”

Sanders has repeatedly highlighted Walmart as an example of startling inequality in America comparing the Waltons’ vast fortune with the supermarkets low paid workers, many of whom get by on government-issued food stamps and Medicaid – the health cover programme joint-funded by state and federal government. Sanders often claims that the Walton family collectively has more wealth than the bottom 40% of Americans.

A spokesman for Walmart, which owns Asda in the UK, said: “If Senator Sanders attends, we hope he will approach his visit not as a campaign stop, but as a constructive opportunity to learn about the many ways we’re working to provide increased economic opportunity, mobility and benefits to our associates.”

In addition, institutional shareholder advisory services Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) have recommended that shareholders vote against Walmart at the meeting. Glass Lewis has advised investors vote down Walmart’s remuneration plans stating that there is a “pay and performance disconnect”. ISS has also advised shareholders vote for a motion demanding that Walmart strengthens oversight to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace.

Walmart workers invited a special guest to crash the company's annual meeting: Bernie Sanders

For years, Walmart workers have attended the company's annual shareholders meeting to call for higher wages, better benefits and more predictable schedules.

This year they'll have someone new delivering the message on their behalf: Sen. Bernie Sanders.

The presidential candidate, who has repeatedly called on Walmart to improve its working conditions, is heading to Bentonville, Ark., on June 5 to introduce a shareholders' proposal that would give hourly Walmart workers a seat on the company's board.

"These workers need and deserve a seat at the table," Sanders (I-Vt.) told The Washington Post. "If hourly workers at Walmart were well represented on its board, I doubt you would see the CEO of Walmart making over a thousand times more than its average worker."

If passed, the measure would require the retailer to consider its 1.5 million hourly U.S. employees when nominating candidates to its board, which is currently companies of a dozen wealthy executives from companies like McDonald's and NBCUniversal.

"At a time of deepening racial and economic divide and insecurity, hourly associates can guide a more fair, inclusive and equitable corporate ecosystem that bridges differences," the proposal says. It was filed by Walmart employee Cat Davis, who is also a leader for workers' rights organization United for Respect.

"We really want Walmart to think about us — the lowly associates who, behind the scenes, are the ones bringing in the money," said Davis, who works as certified pharmacy technician in New Bern, N.C.

Davis said she invited Sanders to speak at the shareholders meeting because he has supported workers in their fight for better pay and paid sick leave.

In November, Sanders introduced legislation aimed at getting Walmart to offer better pay and benefits. The "Stop Walmart Act," would prohibit corporations from buying back their own stock — which drives up share prices and ultimately benefits shareholders — unless they pay all workers $15 an hour, offer seven days of paid sick leave and limit executive compensation to 150 times median employee pay. (Walmart chief executive Doug McMillon last year was paid $23.6 million, or 1,076 times the median Walmart worker's salary of roughly $22,000, according to company filings.)

"Walmart is not a poor company," Sanders said. "Workers are sick and tired of being paid poverty wages, while the Walton family is worth over $170 billion."

The measure, though, is not likely to pass. Walmart shareholders have voted down every employee proposal in company history, according to United for Respect. The Walton family owns about half of the company's shares, meaning it has considerable control over votes.

A spokeswoman for Walmart said the company would not comment on Davis's proposal until it was formally presented at the meeting.

"We're proud of the fact that 75 percent of our U.S. management associates began their career as frontline hourly associates," the company said in a statement. "If Senator Sanders attends, we hope he will approach his visit not as a campaign stop, but as a constructive opportunity to learn about the many ways we're working to provide increased economic opportunity, mobility and benefits to our associates — as well as our widely recognized leadership on environmental sustainability."

Walmart's board currently has nine men and three women, including Stephen J. Easterbrook, the chief executive of McDonald's; Marissa Mayer, the former chief executive of Yahoo; and three members of the Walton family.

At least two other shareholder proposals will also be up for a vote during the annual meeting: one that calls on Walmart to take additional measures to prevent workplace sexual harassment, and another that would change the way shareholders vote for board members. Walmart is advising shareholders to against both, according to the company's proxy filing.

Sanders will hardly be the only well-known personality at the company's shareholder festivities, where surprise headliners like Katy Perry, Blake Shelton and Mariah Carey have become the norm. Thousands gather at the University of Arkansas's Bud Walton Arena every year for the multiday event, which is part pep rally, part pop concert and includes shareholder votes on a range of matters.

Amazon last year raised its starting hourly wage to $15 an hour after Sanders introduced a bill that called on the company to pay its workers a "living wage." (Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)

Equal Pay

In the recent case of Asda Stores Limited v Brierley, the Court of Appeal has upheld the decision that staff working on the supermarket's shop floor can compare themselves to warehouse staff for the purposes of equal pay.

Over 7,000 store-based employees, the majority of whom were female, felt that their customer-facing roles were undervalued when compared with higher paid staff working in Asda's distribution centres, who were predominantly male. They were engaged under different regimes and management structures, with supermarket staff employed on 'retail terms' and warehouse staff employed on 'distribution terms'. For equal pay comparisons, claimants and their comparators need to be working at the same establishment, or at establishments where common terms are observed.

The Court of Appeal agreed with the Employment Appeal Tribunal that there were common terms generally between the claimants and comparators. The retail and distribution terms were broadly comparable and the differences were not significant enough to undermine this. Although they were employed at different establishments, both supermarket and warehouse employees had common terms and conditions that would apply regardless of where they worked. As a result of this, the equal pay claims could proceed.

The Court of Appeal confirmed that a hypothetical test could be applied to consider if different terms would apply if staff were moved to do their own jobs at the other site (even if, in reality, this would never happen). Looking beyond such a comparison, claimants still need to demonstrate that the roles are of equal value and that there is no reason for the unequal pay other than sex discrimination.

Automatically Unfair Dismissal and TUPE Transfers

In the recent case of Hare Wines Limited v Kaur, the Court of Appeal has held that having purely personal reasons for a dismissal linked to a TUPE transfer does not stop the dismissal from being automatically unfair.

Mrs Kaur worked as a cashier in H&W Wholesale Limited ('H&W'), a wine wholesale business. She had a long-standing, strained relationship with one of her colleagues, Mr Chatha. Neither of them was strictly to blame but they had difficulty working together. Mr Chatha was going to become a director of Hares Wines Limited ('HW').

Due to financial reasons, H&W had to stop trading. It was decided that HW would take over the business and so TUPE would apply. On the day of the transfer, Mrs Kaur was dismissed by H&W. The dismissal letter simply stated that this was because it had to stop trading. However, Mrs Kaur was told that Mr Chatha did not want her at HW, and so did not want her employment to transfer across, due to their poor relationship.

Mrs Kaur brought a claim for automatic unfair dismissal. The Employment Tribunal found that, because the sole or main reason for the dismissal was the transfer, her dismissal was automatically unfair in law. HW unsuccessfully appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal and the Court of Appeal.

The Court of Appeal agreed that the reason for the dismissal was the transfer. This was supported by the fact that Mrs Kaur was dismissed on the day of the transfer and the poor relationship between her and Mr Chatha had gone on for many years without H&W seeking to dismiss her. The Court of Appeal noted that, although a dismissal can potentially be fair due to an economic, technical or organisational reason, the law does not recognise any category of 'personal' reason to prevent such a dismissal from being automatically unfair.

Religious Discrimination

In the recent case of Gan Menachem Hendon Limited v De Groen, the Employment Appeal Tribunal ('EAT') has held that a teacher who was dismissed for living with her boyfriend was not subjected to religious discrimination.

Ms De Groen worked at an ultra-orthodox Jewish nursery. Some of the parents found out that she was living with her boyfriend. As cohabitation outside marriage was against their beliefs, the nursery was concerned that this would damage their reputation. They asked Ms De Groen to say she no longer lived with her boyfriend so the message could be relayed to parents, even though this was not true. Ms De Groen refused to lie and was dismissed for acting contrary to the nursery's 'culture, ethos and religious beliefs'. She brought claims for direct sex discrimination and harassment, and direct and indirect religious discrimination. The Employment Tribunal upheld all of her claims in the first instance.

However, the EAT allowed the nursery's appeal against the claim of religious discrimination claims. It clarified that the law protects people with 'protected characteristics', such as religion or belief. The religion of the individual is therefore what is relevant, not the religion of the discriminator. The Tribunal in the first instance was wrong because Ms De Groen was not discriminated against due to her own religious beliefs (or lack of belief) but those of the nursery. Less favourable treatment due to the employer's own religious belief does not establish direct discrimination. The EAT also found that there was no indirect religious discrimination, although it upheld Ms De Groen's sex discrimination claims.

Working Time Directive

The Advocate General ('AG') in Federacion de Servicios de Comisiones Obreras v Deutsche Bank SAE has suggested that, in order to comply with the Working Time Directive, employers must keep records of actual hours worked for those who have not expressly agreed to work overtime, individually or collectively.

In the case, a Spanish trade union wanted a declaration that a bank had to record the actual number of hours its employees worked to ensure that working time laws were complied with. This comes from both national law and EU law, under the Working Time Directive. The Spanish Court was unsure if their law complied with EU law so it referred questions to the European Court of Justice ('ECJ'). The AG said the ECJ should decide that EU law requires employers to record actual daily working time for full-time workers who have not agreed to work overtime. This is essential in ensuring compliance with working time laws, such as the limits on the length of each working day and daily and weekly rest periods. Although the AG's opinion is not binding, it is usually followed by the ECJ.

If the ECJ agrees, there may be a question over whether English law complies with the EU Directive. Although our Working Time Regulations require employers to keep records showing that the weekly working time and night work limits are not exceeded, it does not cover daily or weekly rest and does not require all hours of work to be recorded.

WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR

Age Discrimination: New Acas Guidance

Acas has published new guidance on age discrimination which provides useful insight for employers, managers and HR professionals to reduce the risk of age discrimination in the workplace. Age discrimination is one of the most common forms of unfair treatment at work and many employers are unaware of the law and its consequences. Employees are protected against unfair treatment because of their age, the age they are thought to be or the age of someone they are associated with. They are also protected from harassment related to age.

The guidance can be found at www.acas.org.uk/agediscrimination. It offers tips on how to avoid bias and preconceptions based on age, including a 'top ten' list of useful practices and a 'myths v facts' sheet.

Brexit: Employee Passports

Those with less than six months until their passport expires could experience problems if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Employers should be aware that UK employees who travel to the EU for work could be affected. With approximately 4.8 million people making such journeys in 2017 and with millions of passports set to expire this year, many businesses could be affected by long delays in the processing of applications. Passports should therefore be renewed in good time. Government guidance states that, after 29 March 2019, people should have at least six months left on their passport from their date of arrival. More information can be found here.

The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

DAVE BRIGGS, CNN ANCHOR: All right. Early Start continues right now with the latest out of the Middle East.

TEXT: Coming Up: Missiles In The Gulf?

CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: CNN with new information on what the U.S. believes to be missiles on Iranian freighters in the Persian Gulf.

TEXT: Coming Up: Costly Tariffs

BRIGGS (VOICE-OVER): Walmart now says it will raise prices on some items because of President Trump's tariffs on China.

TEXT: Coming Up: Fighter Jet Crash

UNKNOWN MALE: That's a military airplane in our building.

ROMANS (VOICE-OVER): A fighter jet comes crashing through the roof of a California warehouse after the pilot ejects.

TEXT: Coming Up: Big Changes

BRIGGS (VOICE-OVER): And, big changes are coming to the SATs. New scores for students that have little to do with academics.

BRIGGS: Good morning everyone and welcome to Early Start. I'm Dave Briggs.

ROMANS: And, I'm Christine Romans. It is Friday May 17th. It is 5:00 a.m. in the east. It's 1:30 p.m. in Tehran. Let's begin there. The U.S. believes Iran is using commercial ships in the Persian Gulf to carry missiles. A U.S. official tells CNN, the government has multiple images of Iranian freighters that have been modified. The U.S. claims the pictures show large areas of the decks removed to carry missiles instead. CNN has not reviewed the intelligence supporting the U.S. assessment and the government has not provided any proof the ships are carrying missiles or other munitions. UNKNOWN (VOICE-OVER): President Trump is trying to curb the intensifying conflict with Iran. "The New York Times" reports the president, on Wednesday, told Acting Defense Secretary, Patrick Shanahan, he does not want to go to war. That message, also aimed at his more hawkish aides, underscored at a brief White House photo op yesterday.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REPORTER: Mr. President, are we going to war with Iran?

DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: I hope not.

BRIGGS (VOICE-OVER): The president apparently searching for a diplomatic way out of this mounting crisis. But, are Iranian leaders doing the same? Senior International Correspondent, Fred Pleitgen, live for us in Tehran. Fred interesting reporting from the "Wall Street Journal" suggests the U.S. and Iran were misreading one another, just further complicating this confrontation.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Good morning, Dave. And, misreading each other possibly continuing to misread one another with both sides apparently thinking that the other might be trying to start offensive operations and both sides apparently thinking that they are the ones who are on the defensive in all of this

Of course, a lot of potential for miscalculation in an area, especially there in the Persian Gulf where the U.S. and Iranian forces are always in very close proximity, and continue to be so, and in the wider region as well. Quite interesting developments overnight. Iran's foreign minister saying once again that at this point in time there are not going to be any negotiations with the Trump administration.

But, essentially, what the Iranians are saying is that they want the U.S. to take away some of the punishing sanctions that the Trump administration has put on Iran. The Iranians want to be able to sell their oil on international markets. The Iranians want companies, for instance from Europe, to be able to invest here in Iran without having to fear the wrath of the United States, or American sanctions.

And in an ideal world, the Iranians are saying they want the U.S. to get back into the nuclear agreement. Of course, we know right now, current Trump White House, that's not necessarily something that is going to happen anytime soon, at least if you believe the officials in the Trump White House.

Now, as far as that new intelligence is concerned Dave, we haven't heard anything officially from the Iranians about those claims that that are being made. But, there was an interesting nugget that we didn't pick up for an interview from Iran's ambassador to the U.N. He said that Iran is not preparing for any sort of conflict, but Iran wants to be prepared in case the conflict starts. So, again, the Iranians are saying that they are the ones who are in a defensive posture, goes back to what we were saying at the beginning. A lot of potential for miscalculation here in this very volatile region.

BRIGGS: Boy, there sure is. Fred Pleitgen live for us, 1:33 p.m. there in Tehran. Thank you.

ROMANS: Glad to have him there for us. Attorney General Bill Barr says explanations he's been given for the origin of the Russia probe don't hang together, his words. Barr telling "Fox News" during a visit to El Salvador that he now has more questions today than when he first started investigating the investigation.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

WILLIAM 'BILL' BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: People have to find out what the government was doing during that period. If we're worried about foreign influence, for the very same reason we should be worried about whether government officials abused their power, and put their thump on the scale, And so, I'm not saying that happened, but I'm saying that we have to look at that.

ROMANS (VOICE-OVER): CNN reporting earlier this week that Barr has appointed a top federal prosecutor to look into the genesis of the Russian investigation. Barr has also enlisted the help of the CIA and the Director of National Intelligence.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BRIGGS (VOICE-OVER): New details about Michael Flynn's cooperation with Special Counsel Robert Mueller unsealed court records show the convicted former National Security Adviser flagged multiple attempts to obstruct justice. Flynn told Mueller that people connected to the Trump administration or Congress called him potentially trying to influence.

[05:05:00]

BRIGGS (VOICE-OVER): Flynn even gave Mueller a voicemail recording of the conversations. A federal judge's order the public release by May 31st portions of the Mueller report related to Flynn, sections that may still be redacted. The judge also ordered the release of transcripts of Flynn's conversations with Russian officials during the transition, and the transcript of the voicemail Flynn gave Mueller

ROMANS: House Intelligence Committee Chairman, Adam Schiff, says he's ready to take enforcement action against the Justice Department for not complying with his subpoena for counterintelligence information from the Special Counsel's probe.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CA: They can't even give a full 450 pages to a Democratic Congress, but they gave ultimately over a million pages of discovery to the Republican Congress. They have been able to provide no justification for that double standard and hypocrisy. They're going to have to defend that in court If they press this.

ROMANS (VOICE-OVER): Sciff told reporters the committee will hold a meeting next week to take unspecified action against the Justice Department for not handing over the documents, but a letter obtained by CNN reveals the Justice Department offered Wednesday to show all committee members a less redacted version of Robert Mueller's support. Schiff did not say whether he would move to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt. The House Judiciary Committee already did that after the department declined to provide the panel with the unredacted Mueller report and supporting evidence.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BRIGGS (VOICE-OVER): President Trump announcing his broad plan to reform border security, and illegal immigration, calling for changes that would favor young, educated immigrants instead of those with family ties to the U.S. The measure calls for a points-based system that would favor highly-skilled, financially self-sufficient immigrants who learn English and pass a civics exam.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: Random selection is contrary to American values. Under these senseless rules of the current system, we're not able to give preference to a doctor, a researcher, a student who graduated number one in his class from the finest colleges in the world. We discriminate against genius. We discriminate against brilliance. We won't anymore once we get this passed.

BRIGGS (VOICE-OVER): Trump cast the measure as a consensus plan that would solve one of Washington's most stubborn challenges. But the plan faces an uphill battle even among Republicans. Democrats are all but certain to oppose it calling the changes drastic and inhumane. As expected, it does not propose any legal status for so-called Dreamers, young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, leaving that issue unresolved.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROMANS (VOICE-OVER): All right. Today, lawmakers in the Missouri House are expected to pass a bill banning abortion after eight weeks of pregnancy. The state Senate approved the measure Thursday 24 to 10. All of the yes votes came from Republicans. Three of them women. Governor Mike Parson has already promised to sign the Bill with has no exceptions for rape or incest. The Bill is among several strict abortion laws passing recently in red states. Alabama Governor, Kay Ivey, signed a flat out ban Wednesday. All the measures aimed at giving the Supreme Court an opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade.

BRIGGS: President Trump reporting income of at least $434 million for 2018. That, according to an annual financial disclosure just released by the White House.

TEXT: TRUMP'S INCOME - 2018: at least $434M - $40.8M from Trump International Hotel, $22.7M from Mar-A-Lago Resort. 2017 reported income: at least $450M - At least $315M outstanding debt, $25.1M from Mar-A-Lago Resort.

BRIGGS (VOICE-OVER): The figure includes $40.8M million in revenue from the Trump International Hotel, located just blocks from the White House, and $22.7 million for his Mar-A-Lago Resort in Florida. Down from the $25.1 million he disclosed for 2017. Overall, the president's income appears to have decreased from the $450 million plus he reported in 2017. Mr. Trump also reports holding outstanding debt of at least $315 million.

Tonight at 9:00 Eastern, CNN's Erin Burnett investigates how President Trump and his family do business. A CNN special report "The Trump Family Business" tonight 9 o'clock here on CNN.

ROMANS (VOICE-OVER): All right this is what a trade war looks like. America's largest retailer, Walmart says it will raise prices on some products because of President Trump's tariffs on China.

TEXT: "We're going to continue to do everything we can to keep prices low. That's who we are. However, increased tariffs will lead to increased prices, we believe, for our customers." - Brett Biggs, Chief Financial Officer, Walmart.

ROMANS (VOICE-OVER): Its CFO, Brett Biggs, said Thursday we're going to continue to do everything we can to keep prices low. That's who we are. However, increased tariffs will lead to increased prices we believe for our customers. He did not say which items will become more expensive, but noted Walmart is working with its suppliers to manage the price increases.

But here's what Kevin Hassett, the Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Here's what he said last night to Erin Burnett about Walmart's announcement.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ERIN BURNETT, CNN NEWS ANCHOR: CFO of Walmart know what he's talking about? I mean, I don't think the CFO of Walmart is going to go out and say prices are going to go up unless he looked at it, and knew they were going to go up.

KEVIN HASSETT: CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS: You go up and down the aisles, there's a million things. And, of course, there could be some products that don't have close substitutes, but a lot of them do. And then, in the end it's empirical question, which is dominating, and if you look at inflation in the U.S. it's been decelerating. And so, I don't think that you could say that the president caused this but --

[05:10:00]

BURNETT: You think he's got it wrong. OK. So, the president --

KEVIN HASSETT: CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS: It's not in the data what he's saying. That's not in the aggregate data, for sure.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROMANS: Clearly, the White House strategy to downplay what will be a consumer effect of all of these tariffs . Walmart is not the only retailer warning that tariffs will hit customers. Macy's, Wednesday, said it will raise prices on some merchandise because of the trade war. But, on the other side of Trump's tariffs Stanley Black & Decker announced plans to move production of its craftsman wrenches out of China and back to the U.S., building a new plant in Fort Worth, Texas. That plant is going to open late 2020.

Stanley said the Fort Worth plant will employ 500 full-time workers. And, it's going to be a high-tech plant, right? With all kinds of cool technology robotics, a real upgrade from the lower tech plant that it had.

BRIGGS: It's not just the houses of jobs created --

ROMANS: Exactly.

BRIGGS: -- because of the automation

ROMANS: Exactly.

BRIGGS: -- but , hey --

ROMANS: Automation and fewer jobs, tariffs moving those to other countries. You know, Cambodia, Vietnam, and in this case, United States.

BRIGGS: All right. Ahead, some major changes to the SAT on the way that have more to do with where you live instead of what you study.

ROMANS: Plus the fighter jet that plunged through the roof of a California warehouse.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[05:16:05]

ROMANS (VOICE-OVER): An F16 fighter jet crashing on takeoff from March Air Reserve Base near Riverside, California. The plane slammed through the roof of a nearby warehouse.

UNKNOWN MALE: That's a (expletive) airplane. That's a military airplane in our building.

ROMANS (VOICE-OVER): Air Force officials say a hydraulic failure led to the jet's crash. The pilot ejected before impact and had no major injuries. The CEO of the company in the warehouse says his employees are all safe thankfully, but Air Force Air Base officials say five people were injured on the ground, and we have reached out for details on their conditions.

BRIGGS: South Bend Mayor and Democratic Candidate, Pete Buttigieg, talking to CNN about his military service. He frequently makes reference to it on the campaign trail. And Jeff Zeleny asked him about coming out as gay after serving in Afghanistan and while still in uniform.

MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG, SOUTH BEND, IN, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It was the reflecting I did while I was overseas. Talking to so many people who made it clear that their purpose in life, their motivation for making sure they came home safe. The reason I needed to make sure they came home safe, if they were in my vehicle, was that they want to get home to the people they loved. And, realizing that I'm a grown man, I'm an officer, I'm a mayor, and I've no idea what it's like to be in love. That situation became more and more untenable in my mind while I was serving. And so, I think it did kind of push me over the edge when I could have found more excuses to just take my time on coming out.

BRIGGS: Fox's Steve Hilton asking President Trump what he thought of having a publicly gay rival for the White House. Listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

STEVE HILTON: HOST, THE NEXT REVOLUTION, FOX NEWS: Don't you think it's just great to see the fact that you've got a guy there on the stage with his husband, and it's normal, it's not a vaccine.

DONALD TRUMP, UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: I think it's absolutely fine. I do.

HILTON: Isn't it a sign of great progress in the country that that's just --

TRUMP: Yes. I think it's great. I think that's something that perhaps some people will have a problem with. I have no problem with it whatsoever. I think it's good.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BRIGGS: Buttigieg is one of three Democrats running for president, who served in America's longest wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

ROMANS: All right. Changes are coming to the SAT exam, and a diversity score is being added to the test. It will take into account a student's social and economic background. The college board that administers the SAT says it will be implementing -- here we go -- Environmental Context Dashboard, which measures factors like the crime rate and poverty levels of a student's neighborhood. The score will be rolled out to 150 schools this year, and more widely in 2020. The idea is to better capture an applicant's resourcefulness to overcome challenges and achieve more with less. The change comes as colleges face heightened scrutiny over the admissions process and the diversity of their student bodies.

BRIGGS: Very interesting. All right. Ahead Steph Curry and the World Champion Warriors stealing Game 2 of the Western Conference Finals. They needed a huge comeback to do it. Andy Scholes has that story in the "Bleacher Report" live from Bethpage Black, next.

[05:19:10]

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[15:24:00] BRIGGS: Tiger Woods' bid for back-to-back majors not looking so great after one round in the PGA Championship. Andy Scholes is live at Bethpage Black with more in the "Bleacher Report". Good morning my friend.

ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Good morning David. Tiger Woods nine shots back in the lead here at the PGA Championship thanks to the reigning champ Brooks Koepka. You know, these two guys are playing together in Rounds 1 and 2. And, my colleague, Don Riddell, actually asked Koepka earlier in the week if he was intimidated at all playing with Tiger in his group, and Koepka said, why would I be. It's not like we're fighting, and he's going to punch me in the teeth.

Koepka certainly looking fearless in Round 1. Yesterday, here at Bethpage Black, seven birdies, no bogeys. Koepka finished with a course record 63, and it could have been even better as he was really not in any trouble all day long. Koepka is looking to make history here this week on top of winning last year's PGA Championship. Koepka, two time reigning U.S. Open Champ, and no one has ever held back-to- back titles in two majors at the same time.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BROOKS KOEPKA, U.S. OPEN CHAMPION: I won this last year. You know, I'm playing good.

[05:25:00]

You know, it was great that Tiger won Augusta, but I mean we're at a new leap now (ph) that was one of the best rounds I've played probably as a professional.

You know obviously it's never been -- I mean it's never been this confident (ph). I think, you know, I'm still learning -- understanding my game. And I've figured it out.

SCHOLES: All right, Tiger meanwhile is going to have to have a really good day if he hopes to get in to contention here at Bethpage Black. You know, I followed Tiger around yesterday. This course here, it's like a roller coaster with how hilly it is, and that's pretty much how Tiger's round was yesterday it was like a roller coaster.

He double bogeyed two holes on his front nine, he would battle (ph) back to get under par after an eagle on four but then he just struggled to end his round -- finished two over par for the day.

TIGER WOODS, 4-TIME PGA CHAMPIONSHIP WINNER: It wasn't as clean as I'd like to have it, for sure. Didn't get off to a very good start, but I fought my way back around there and unfortunately I just didn't keep it together at the end.

SCHOLES: All right, the Western Conference Finals also known as the Curry Sibling Rivalry Series continuing last night, mom and dad still rocking those combo jerseys of their sons Steph and Seth.

The Blazers had a 17 point lead in the third quarter, but that's when Steph got red hot, he would lead the Warriors all the way back, finish with 37 points in the game. About a minute to go, his little brother Seth hits a huge three to put the Blazers up by one. Warriors would though regain the lead in the closing second.

Andre Iguodala is going to steal the ball from Damian Lillard to seal the victory -- Warriors win 114, 111 to take a 2-0 lead in this series.

All right, back here in New York today's second round at the PGA Championships -- very important, Dave. In the last 60 years only one guy has come from outside the top 25 after 36 holes to win this tournament. And Tiger Woods right now tied for 51st, so he's got a lot of work to do. It's all not going to matter if Brooks Koepka plays like he did yesterday and shoots low again, because he could run away with this tournament.

BRIGGS: And he's so poised -- he's won major championships before. Don't looks for Brooks Koepka to fold. Also, congrats to the Boston Bruins back in the Stanley Cup Final. Good for the folks in Boston, they don't get a whole lot of taste of championship success.

Andy Scholes, good to see you my friend.

SCHOLES: All right.

BRIGGS: Enjoy Friday at Bethpage. Romans?

ROMANS: All right, thanks Dave.

Photos of Iranian ships carrying missiles in the Persian Gulf raising some tensions between Iran and the U.S., but both countries are they misreading (ph) their own intelligence -- we've got a live report inside Tehran next.

[04:31:14] CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR: CNN with new information on what the U.S. believes to be missiles on Iranian -- freighters, rather, in the Persian Gulf.

DAVE BRIGGS, CNN ANCHOR: Walmart now says it will raise prices on some items because of President Trump's tariffs on China.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's a military airplane in our building.

ROMANS: A fighter jet comes crashing through the roof of a California warehouse after the pilot ejects.

BRIGGS: Big changes coming to the SATs. New scores for students that have nothing to do with academics. This may have a dramatic impact on how your kids get into college.

Welcome back to EARLY START. I'm Dave Briggs.

ROMANS: Nothing to do with academics and everything to do with academics at the same time, you know.

BRIGGS: Yes. Trying to level the playing field.

ROMANS: That's right.

I'm Christine Romans. It's Friday, everybody. Hope you're having a great end to your week. It's 31 minutes past the hour.

Let's begin here, the U.S. believes Iran is using commercial ships in the Persian Gulf to carry missiles. A U.S. official tells CNN the government has multiple images of Iranian freighters that have been modified. The U.S. claims the pictures show large areas of the decks removed to carry missiles. Now CNN has not reviewed the intelligence supporting the U.S. assessment and the government has not provided any proof the ships are carrying missiles or other munitions.

BRIGGS: President Trump is trying to curve the intensifying conflict with Iran. "The New York Times" reports the president on Wednesday told acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan he does not want to go to war. That message also aimed at his more hawkish aides was underscored in a brief White House photo-op yesterday.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Mr. President, are we going to war with Iran?

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I hope not.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BRIGGS: The president apparently searching for a diplomatic way out of the mounting crisis. Are Iranian leaders doing the same.

Let's bring in senior international correspondent Fred Pleitgen live in Tehran.

Fred, good morning to you. The "Wall Street Journal" reporting really highlights the miscommunication here. Both sides misreading one another.

FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, both sides thinking that the other side is the one that's escalating the situation, Dave, and both sides apparently thinking that the other one is trying to start some sort of offensive military operation.

It's quite interesting to hear from the Iranians because on the one hand they say they don't want an escalation in the situation. They want things to calm down, but at the same time, they're also saying that there are not going to be any sort of negotiations with the Trump administration at this point in time.

Essentially what the Iranians have said in the form of Iran's supreme leader is they have said, look, with the current policy of the United States, with that massive sanctions policy, the Iranians are simply not going to talk to this Trump White House. They want to be able to sell their oil on international markets again. They want companies to be able to invest in Iran here again without facing the wrath of the United States.

And in an ideal world, they say they also want the U.S. to go back to the nuclear agreement. Now of course we know the current situation in the White House that does not seem to be something that's in the cards. So the supreme leader has said at this point in time there's not going to be any negotiations with the U.S. and overnight the Iranian Foreign minister has said that once again.

Now as far as that new intelligence that we've learned is concerned, it's quite interesting to hear because so far there's nothing official from the Iranians denying any of that. However there was an interview by Iran's ambassador to the U.N. which was on Iranian state media overnight where he said, look, the Iranians are not preparing to go into any conflict. But the Iranians want to be prepared in case a conflict starts, so the Iranians essentially saying any sort of movement that they're conducting right now are defensive in nature. One of the things that we have heard from the Iranians is that yes, they have beefed up their naval presence in the Persian Gulf area so that certainly is something that is going off. But again the Iranians are saying all of that defensive in nature -- Dave.

[04:05:01] BRIGGS: OK. Fred Pleitgen live for us just past 1:00 p.m. in Tehran. Thank you.

ROMANS: All right. Attorney General Bill Barr says explanations he has been given for the origin of the Russia probe, quote, "don't hang together." Barr telling FOX News during a visit to El Salvador that he now has more questions today than when he first started investigating the investigation.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: People have to find out what the government was doing during that period. If we're -- if we're worried about foreign influence for the very same reason we should be worried about whether government officials abuse their power and put their thumb on the scale. And so I'm not saying that happened but I'm saying that we have to look at that.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROMANS: CNN reporting earlier this week that Barr has appointed a top federal prosecutor to look into the genesis of the Russia probe. Barr has also enlisted the help of the CIA and the director of National Intelligence.

BRIGGS: New details about Michael Flynn's cooperation with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Unsealed court records show the convicted former National Security adviser flagged multiple attempts to obstruct justice. Flynn told Mueller that people connected to the Trump administration or Congress called him potentially trying to obstruct. Flynn even gave Mueller a voicemail recording of one of their conversations.

A federal judge has ordered the public release by May 31st of portions of the Mueller report related to Flynn. Sections that may still be redacted. The judge also ordered the release of transcripts for Flynn's conversations with Russian officials during the transition and the transcript of the voicemail Flynn gave Mueller.

ROMANS: House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff says he's ready to take enforcement action against the Justice Department for not complying with his subpoena for counterintelligence information from the special counsel's probe.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): They can't even give 450 pages to a Democratic Congress but they gave ultimately over a million pages of discovery to the Republican Congress. They have been able to provide no justification for that double standard and hypocrisy. They're going to have to defend that in court if they press this. (END VIDEO CLIP)

ROMANS: Schiff told reporters the committee will hold a meeting next week to take unspecified action against the Justice Department for not handing over the documents but a letter obtained by CNN reveals the Justice Department offered Wednesday to show all committee members a less redacted version of Robert Mueller's report.

Schiff did not say whether he would move to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt. The House Judiciary Committee already did that after the department declined to provide the panel with the unredacted Mueller report and supporting evidence.

BRIGGS: President Trump announcing his broad plan to reform border security and legal immigration, calling for changes that would favor young, educated immigrants instead of those with family ties to the U.S. The measure calls for a points based system that would favor highly skilled, financially self-sufficient immigrants who learned English and passed a civics exam.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: Random selection is contrary to American values. Under the senseless rules of the current system, we're not able to give preference to a doctor, a researcher, a student who graduated number one in his class from the finest colleges in the world.

We discriminate against genius. We discriminate against brilliance. We won't anymore, once we get this passed.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BRIGGS: Trump cast the measure as a consensus plan that would solve one of Washington's most stubborn challenges but the plan faces an uphill battle, even among Republicans. Democrats are all but certain to oppose it calling the changes drastic and inhumane. As expected it does not propose any legal status for so-called Dreamers, young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children leaving that key issue unresolved.

ROMANS: All right. Today lawmakers in the Missouri House are expected to pass a bill banning abortion after eight weeks of pregnancy. The state Senate approved the measure Thursday, 24-10. All of the yes votes came from Republicans, three of them women. Governor Mike Parson has already promised to sign that bill which has no exceptions for rape or incest.

The bill is among strict abortion laws passing recently in several states. Alabama Governor Kay Ivey signed a flat-out ban Wednesday. All the measures aimed at giving the Supreme Court an opportunity to overturn "Roe versus Wade."

BRIGGS: President Trump reporting income of at least $434 million for 2018. That according to an annual financial disclosure just released by the White House. The figure includes $40.8 million in revenue from the Trump International Hotel located just blocks from the White House, and $22.7 million for his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Down from $25.1 million he disclosed in 2017.

Overall the president's income appears to have decreased a bit from the $450 million plus he reported earnings in 2017.

[04:40:03] Mr. Trump also reports holding outstanding debt of at least $315 million.

Tonight at 9:00 Eastern, CNN's Erin Burnett investigates how President Trump and his family do business. A CNN report, "THE TRUMP FAMILY BUSINESS." That's again tonight at 9:00 here on CNN.

ROMANS: All right. This is what a trade war looks like. America's largest retailer Walmart says it will raise prices on some products because of President Trump's tariffs on China. Its CFO Brett Biggs said Thursday, "We're going to continue to do everything we can to keep prices low. That's who we are. However, increased tariffs will lead to increased prices we believe for our consumers." He did not say which items will become more expensive but noted Walmart is working with its suppliers to manage prices.

But here's what Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for the president, said last night about Walmart's announcement.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ERIN BURNETT, CNN ANCHOR: Wouldn't the CFO of Walmart know what he's talking about? I mean, I don't think the CFO of Walmart would go out and say prices are going up unless he looked at it and knew they were going to go up.

KEVIN HASSETT, CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS: You go up and down the aisle, there's a million things and of course there are going to be some products that don't have close substitutes but a lot of them do. And then in the end, it's an empirical question which is dominating, and if you look at inflation in the U.S. it's been decelerating. And so I don't think that you could say that the tariffs have caused this but --

BURNETT: But you think he's got it wrong. OK. So the president --

HASSETT: Yes. It's not in the data what he's saying. Not in the aggregate data for sure.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROMANS: Clearly the White House wants to downplay this notion that consumers are going to pay the price for the president's trade war.

Now Walmart isn't the only retailer warning that tariffs will hurt consumers. Macy's announced Wednesday it will raise prices on some merchandise because of the trade war. On the other side, though, of Trump's tariffs, Stanley Black & Decker announced it plans to move production of its craftsman wrenches out of China and to the U.S. building a new plant in Fort Worth that will open in late 2020. The tariffs make it profitable for them -- more profitable for them to make them here in the United States. Stanley said the Fort Worth plant would employ 500 full-time employees. Another part of that story, some of the manufacturing moving is also technology, right. Some of these plants in China have been there 20, 30 years now, so they've got old equipment and they have the same labor force they've always had, so if you have artificial intelligence, if you have robotics, if you have high-tech new equipment, and fewer workers in the U.S., Cambodia or Vietnam, then it makes sense with the tariffs structure --

BRIGGS: To bring it back.

ROMANS: It makes sense to move those plants.

BRIGGS: It's good news amidst the trade war.

Coming up, new SAT scores that have more to do with where you live instead of what you study.

ROMANS: Plus, the fighter jet that plunged through the roof of a California warehouse.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[04:46:49] BRIGGS: An F-16 fighter jet crashing on takeoff from March Air Reserve base near Riverside, California. Well, the plane slammed through the roof of a nearby warehouse.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's (EXPLETIVE DELETED) airplane. That's a military airplane in our building.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BRIGGS: Imagine that. Air Force officials say a hydraulic failure led to the jet's crash. The pilot ejected before impact and had no major injuries. The CEO of the company and the warehouse says his employees are all safe but air base officials say five people were injured on the ground. We have reached out for details on their condition.

ROMANS: A brutal rush hour in Orlando after a single engine plane ran out of fuel and landed on Interstate 4 at 5:25 in the evening. The aircraft struck a car on the Maitland Boulevard onramp. No one was hurt. This is nothing new for the Maitland Fire Department. Do you know that in 2017 a small plane ran out of fuel and made an emergency landing on I-4 in the same general area.

BRIGGS: Boeing says it has completed a software fix for the troubled 737 MAX jet liner. The aircraft maker says in a statement it has flown the updated software on 207 flights for more than 360 hours. The company officials are confident with the new software, the 737 MAX will be, quote, "one of the safest airplanes ever to fly." The FAA and global regulators now have to review the software before the plane can be recertified. The 737 MAX fleet was grounded worldwide following the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes that killed 346 people.

ROMANS: A Tesla Model 3 sedan was on autopilot when it crashed into a semi-truck killing the car's driver. A report by the National Transportation Safety Board says the driver engaged the autopilot just seconds before the fatal accident on a Florida highway back in March. And the driver's hands were not detected on the steering wheel.

This is not the first fatal crash while Tesla's autopilot function was engaged. It raises questions about Tesla's marketing of its semiautonomous driving software. Critics says slapping the autopilot name on to a driver assistance feature can lull people into a false sense of security making them less likely to stay fully alert and more vulnerable to a crash.

BRIGGS: Big changes coming to the SAT exam. An adversity score being added to the test. It will take into account a student's social and economic background. The college board that administers the SATs says it will be implementing an environmental context dash board which measures factors like the crime rate and poverty levels of a student's neighborhood.

The score will be rolled out to 150 schools this year and more widely in 2020. The idea is to better capture an applicant's resourcefulness to overcome challenges and achieve more with less. The change comes as colleges face heightened scrutiny over the admissions process and the diversity of their student bodies.

ROMANS: It will take 10 seconds for rich parent to figure out how to game the system for them. You know, I mean, look at the --

BRIGGS: Perhaps.

ROMANS: The Operation Varsity Blues. People paid to have their scores changed for their kids.

BRIGGS: That needs to be addressed, but are high income towns going to be discriminated against? Is it going to hurt their students?

[04:50:03] ROMANS: We'll see. 49 minutes past the hour.

A new FOX poll has Joe Biden widening his lead over the Democratic field and President Trump in a head-to-head matchup. Take a look at these numbers. Biden has more than double the support of runner-up Bernie Sanders. Elizabeth Warren is a distant third with 9 percent and in a one-on-one contest, Biden beats President Trump by 11 points, 49 to 38 percent. Sanders has a five-point margin over the president and Warren has a two-point edge.

BRIGGS: South Bend mayor and Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg talking to CNN about his military service. He frequently makes reference to it on the campaign trail.

Jeff Zeleny asked him about coming out as gay after serving in Afghanistan and while still in uniform.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D-IN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It was the reflecting I did while I was overseas. Talking to so many people who have made it clear that their purpose in life, their motivation for making sure they came home safe. The reason I needed to make sure they came home safe if they were in my vehicle was that they wanted to get home to the people they loved and realizing that I'm a grown man, I'm an officer, I'm a mayor, and I have no idea what it's like to be in love.

That situation became more and more untenable in my mind while I was serving and so I think it did kind of push me over the edge when I could have found more excuses to just take my time on coming out.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BRIGGS: Buttigieg one of three Democrats running for president who served in America's longest wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

ROMANS: All right. This week marks the end of a television era on two fronts. More on the finales for two favorites, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[04:56:09] BRIGGS: There was laughter and tears during the series finale of the "Big Bang Theory."

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JIM PARSON, ACTOR: I want you to know, in my way, I love you all.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BRIGGS: The CBS sitcom ended its 12th season run Thursday with a one- hour finale that wrapped up several long running story lines. At 279 episodes, the "Big Bang Theory" is the longest running multi-camera series in television history. Fans took to social media to praise the ending that wrapped things up nicely and didn't kill anyone off.

ROMANS: All right. The same probably cannot be said for another highly anticipated series finale.

Yes. The final episode of "Game of Thrones" airs Sunday night on HBO. The eighth and final season of the mega-hit series has been a ratings bonanza, though fans have been mixed on this season. Last week's penultimate episode set yet another record. More than 18 million viewers tuning in for the final battle. So who will end up on the Iron Throne?

Dave, I can't believe you have not seen a single episode of the series.

BRIGGS: I have a question. A lot of people saw "End Game" who had never seen a single "Avengers," though.

ROMANS: Right.

BRIGGS: If I watch this final episode, will I still find some enjoyment from it or just be lost the whole time?

ROMANS: No, you're going to be lost. I think you're going to be lost.

BRIGGS: All right. Well, thanks for trying.

The Rolling Stones are ready to get back on the road.

"Start me up." The band announcing the rescheduled dates for its "No Filter" tour, will kick off June 21st at Soldier Field in Chicago and end in Miami on August 31st. The news comes a day after Mick Jagger posted a video of himself rehearsing his trademark dance moves a little over a month after he had heart surgery. The procedure forced the Stones to postpone the North American leg of their tour.

ROMANS: All right. Let's get a check on CNN Business this morning. Global markets mostly lower. Trade tensions lingering here at the end of the week.

On Wall Street futures pointing down a little bit here. Stocks rose Thursday. The president sending a delegation to China to resume trade talks and he punted on global car tariffs. The Dow closed up 215 points, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both ended higher.

Honestly a day of no negative trade news is a small win for investors and they took that win yesterday. You know, and take a look. Some perspective here. All three major averages are above where they were when this trade war started almost a year ago. It's been a tortured move in between, but you're just a little bit above where you were a year ago, investors.

One to watch today, chip makers in video stock rose after posting strong first quarter earnings. Stocks of other chip makers, though, fell after the U.S. banned Huawei from selling telecom gear. Huawei buys those chips from -- for its gear.

Samsung's 5G phone is officially on the market. The Galaxy X 10 starts at $1300 and is the first smartphone that could access 5G in the U.S. without an attachment. Right now the device is only available for Verizon customers in Chicago and Minneapolis. Samsung plans to launch the phone in more cities on Verizon and work with other carriers. Samsung is now ahead of Apple which is not expected to debut a 5G iPhone until the fourth quarter of 2020.

SpaceX wants to bring cheap broadband internet across the world and it's planning the first step to make that happen. Elon Musk's rocket company will try to deliver 60 satellites, it's calling it Starlink, into a low orbit -- low earth orbit next week. The launch was originally scheduled for Wednesday but delayed because of rough winds. Then SpaceX said Thursday it would wait another week so it can update satellite software and triple check everything again. Elon Musk said SpaceX will need another six missions before Starlink can provide consistent internet coverage for small parts of the world.

BRIGGS: All right. EARLY START continues right now with the latest out of the Middle East.

Good morning. And welcome to EARLY START, everybody. I'm Christine Romans.

BRIGGS: That major changes on how your kids could get into college. I'm Dave Briggs. Friday, May 17th. Happy Friday. It is 4:00 a.m. in the East. Half past noon in Iran. And that's where we begin this morning.

The U.S. believes Iran is using commercial ships in the Persian Gulf to carry missiles. A U.S. official tells CNN the government has multiple images of Iranian freighters that have been modified. The U.S. claims the pictures show large areas of the deck removed to carry missiles.

ROMANS: The president apparently searching for a diplomatic way out of this mounting crisis. Are Iranian leaders doing the same?

Let's bring in senior international correspondent Fred Pleitgen live in Tehran -- Fred.

FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Christine. Well, the Iranians once again have overnight said that there are not going to be any negotiations with the Trump administration at least at this point in time, this time in the form of Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif who was on a visit to Japan, I think is now moving over to China. And essentially what the Iranians are saying is that under these circumstances they are not willing to negotiate specifically with the Trump White House.

They say several things need to happen. First of all, they want some of the sanctions to be lifted off their country. They want to be able to see their oil on international markets. They want companies specifically from Europe to be able to invest in Iran once again without having to fear American backlash or American sanctions.

In an ideal world, they would also like the U.S. to go back into the nuclear agreement but of course judging from the sense of the White House right now that doesn't seem to be something that's in the cards anytime soon.

Now as far as those new satellite images are concerned, we haven't really seen much of a reaction from the Iranians. But I did pick up an interesting nugget just a couple of minutes ago. There was an interview with Iran's ambassador to the United Nations that was put out on Iranian media overnight. And in that he said that the Iranians as he put it are not preparing for any sort of conflict but said they do want to be prepared in case a conflict starts. So essentially the Iranians are saying that any sort of military preparations that they're making in the Persian Gulf area by their standards at least are defensive in nature.

One of the things that we do know from the Iranians is that they have been beefing up their navy in that Persian Gulf region. So certainly they do seem to be preparing for something that could happen. Whether or not that's offensive or defensive of course is a big bone of contention not just in the United States but of course around the world as well -- Christine.

ROMANS: All right. Frederik Pleitgen for us in Tehran this morning. Thanks, Fred.

[04:10:07] And then in the end, it's an empirical question which is dominating, and if you look at inflation in the U.S. it's been decelerating. And so I don't think that you could say that the tariffs have caused this but --

BURNETT: But you think he's got it wrong. So the president --

HASSETT: Yes. It's not in the data what he's saying. Not in the aggregate data for sure.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROMANS: All right. Walmart isn't the only retailer warning the tariffs will hit customers. Macy's announced Wednesday it will raise prices on some merchandise because of the trade war. Now on the other side of Trump's tariffs, Stanley Black & Decker announced plans to move production of its craftsman wrenches out of China and back to the U.S. It's building a new plant in Fort Worth with all kinds of new high technology. That plant is going to open in late 2020.

Stanley said the Fort Worth plant will employ 500 full-time employees. And here's an interesting part about that story. You know, the older equipment they have in China and the workers and the workers' skills they have in China, they're replacing with technology in the U.S. And this is also a high-tech story. So 500 jobs but a lot of robotics and high tech that allow them to make some of these Stanley wrenches in the U.S.

BRIGGS: But will those wrenches be more expensive because they're made here in the U.S.? That may take some time to turn out but --

ROMANS: Well, that's the technology part of it. They're also trying to more -- build more where they are, right?

BRIGGS: Yes.

ROMANS: Which is kind of the reverse of globalization, right. You use to build where the cheapest place was and then spread it wherever it was.

BRIGGS: Protectionism.

ROMANS: Build where they're buying it. That's what they're trying to do.

BRIGGS: All right. This story should matter to you, parents. Coming up, the new SAT scores that have more to do with where you live instead of what you study.

ROMANS: Plus the fighter jet that plunged through a roof of a California warehouse.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[04:16:10] ROMANS: An F-16 fighter jet crashing on takeoff from a March Air Reserve base near Riverside, California. The plane slammed through the roof of a nearby warehouse.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's (EXPLETIVE DELETED) airplane. That's a military airplane in our building.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROMANS: Airport officials say a hydraulic failure led to the jet's crash. The pilot ejected before impact and had no minor injuries. The CEO of the company in the warehouse says his employees are all safe but air base officials say five people were injured on the ground. We have reached out for details on their conditions.

A Tesla Model 3 sedan was on auto pilot when it crashed into a semi- truck killing the car's driver. A report by the National Transportation Safety Board says the driver engaged the autopilot just seconds before the fatal accident on a Florida highway back in March. And the driver's hands were not detected on the steering wheel.

This is not the first fatal crash while Tesla's autopilot function was engaged. And it raises questions about Tesla's marketing of its semiautonomous driving software. Critics says slapping the autopilot name on to a driver assistance feature can lull people into a false sense of security making them less likely to stay fully alert and more vulnerable to a crash.

All right. Changes are coming to the SAT exam. An adversity score is being added to the test. It will take into account a student's social and economic background. The college board that administers the SATs says it will be implementing an environmental context dash board, environmental context dash board which measures factors like the crime rate and poverty levels of a student's neighborhood. The score will be rolled out to 150 schools this year and more widely in 2020. The idea is to better capture an applicant's resourcefulness to overcome challenges and achieve more with less. The change comes as colleges face heightened scrutiny over the admissions process and the diversity of their student bodies.

All right. Mayor Pete Buttigieg gets personal.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D-IN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think it did kind of push me over the edge.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROMANS: The 2020 candidate talks about how his military service in Afghanistan has shaped his life since.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[04:23:12] BRIGGS: 4:22 Eastern Time, and a new FOX poll has Joe Biden widening his lead over the entire Democratic field and President Trump in a head-to-head matchup. Take a look at these numbers. Biden has more than double the support of runner-up Bernie Sanders. Elizabeth Warren is a distant third with 9 percent and in a one-on-one contest, Biden beats President Trump by 11 points, 49 to 38 percent. Sanders has a five-point margin over the president and Warren a two- point edge.

ROMANS: All right. South Bend mayor and Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg talking to CNN about his military service. Now he frequently makes reference to it on the campaign trail.

CNN's Jeff Zeleny asked him about coming out after serving in Afghanistan and while still in uniform.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BUTTIGIEG: It was the reflecting I did while I was overseas. Talking to so many people who have made it clear that their purpose in life, their motivation for making sure they came home safe. The reason I needed to make sure they came home safe if they were in my vehicle was that they wanted to get home to the people they loved and realizing that I'm a grown man, I'm an officer, I'm a mayor, and I have no idea what it's like to be in love.

That situation became more and more untenable in my mind while I was serving and so I think it did kind of push me over the edge when I could have found more excuses to just take my time on coming out.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROMANS: Buttigieg is one of three Democrats running for president who served in America's longest wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

BRIGGS: A tough launch for Bill de Blasio's long shot presidential campaign. The New York City mayor becoming the 23rd Democrat to enter this race, but he had a tough time laying out his vision during an interview on "Good Morning America." As you can see, police and public housing tenants were protesting outside the studio and came close to drowning him out.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

[04:25:03] UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Liar, liar, liar, liar.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS ANCHOR: So it's a tough city. We're hearing it outside. Some protesters.

MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: A little serenade, George. It's a little serenade.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BRIGGS: The chant was "liar," you see there. The New York City Police Union upset with De Blasio claiming he is stalling on a new labor contract.

ROMANS: All right. There was laughter and tears during the series finale of the "Big Bang Theory."

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want you to know in my way I love you all.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROMANS: All right. The CBS sitcom ended its 12th season run Thursday with a one-hour finale that wrapped up several long running story lines. 279 episodes, the "Big Bang Theory" is the longest running multi-camera series in television history. Fans took to social media to praise the ending that wrapped things up nicely and did not kill anyone off.

(LAUGHTER)

BRIGGS: The same probably cannot be said for another highly anticipated series finale.

The final episode of "Game of Thrones" airs Sunday night on HBO. The eighth and final season of the mega-hit series has been a ratings bonanza, though fans have been mixed on this season itself. Last week's penultimate episode set another record of more than 18 million viewers tuning in for the final battle. So who will end up on the Iron Throne. I know you probably have some theories, Christine.

ROMANS: I have some theories that I'm keeping to myself, and I will not be able to watch it on Sunday night because we get up so early.

BRIGGS: Yes.

ROMANS: So Monday is going to have to be a spoiler-free morning, everyone. You know, just keep it to yourselves for a little bit until everyone can watch it.

BRIGGS: I recommend staying off Twitter.

ROMANS: I know.

BRIGGS: Because it will dominate social media come Monday morning.

ROMANS: I know. All right. Photos of Iranian ships carrying missiles in the Persian Gulf raised tensions between the U.S. and Iran but are both countries misreading their own intelligence? A live report inside Tehran next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[05:32:07] DAVE BRIGGS, CNN ANCHOR: CNN with new information on what the U.S. believes to be missiles on Iranian freighters in the Persian Gulf.

CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR: Walmart now says it will raise prices on some items because of President Trump's tariffs on China.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's a military airplane in our building.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BRIGGS: A fighter jet comes crashing through the roof of a California warehouse after the pilot ejects.

ROMANS: And big changes are coming to the SATs. New scores for students that have nothing to do with academics.

Welcome back to EARLY START. I'm Christine Romans.

BRIGGS: I'm Dave Briggs.

Fascinating changes impacting --

ROMANS: Yes.

BRIGGS: -- the way your kids get into college. We'll talk about that in a bit.

But we start in the Middle East. The U.S. believes Iran is using commercial ships in the Persian Gulf to carry missiles. A U.S. official tells CNN the government has multiple images of Iranian freighters that have been modified. The U.S. claims the pictures show large areas of the decks removed to carry missiles.

CNN has not reviewed the intelligence supporting the U.S. assessment and the government has not provided proof the ships are carrying missiles or other munitions.

ROMANS: President Trump is trying to curb the intensifying conflict with Iran. "The New York Times" reports the president, on Wednesday, told acting Defense Sec. Patrick Shanahan he does not want to go to war. That message also aimed at his more hawkish aides was underscored at a brief White House photo op yesterday.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REPORTER: Mr. President, are we going to war with Iran?

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I hope not.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROMANS: The president apparently searching for a diplomatic way out of this mounting crisis. Are Iranian leaders doing the same?

Let's bring in senior international correspondent Frederik Pleitgen. He is live again this morning for us in Tehran -- Fred.

FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Christine.

Well, the Iranians continue to say that they don't want any sort of escalation in this crisis. They continue to say that they believe it's the U.S. is the one that is escalating things. They say anything that they're doing in the Persian Gulf is defensive in nature.

It was quite interesting because the country's foreign minister, Javad Zarif -- he came out overnight and once again reiterated that at this point in time the Iranians are not willing to hold negotiations with the Trump administration.

The Iranians essentially are saying that before they do that they want to see the U.S. lift some of those punishing sanctions that have been levied against them by the Trump White House before they're going to go into any certain negotiations with the U.S.

They want to be able to sell their oil on international markets. And more so than that, they want European companies and any companies to be able to invest here in Iran without having to face U.S. backlash -- without having to face U.S. sanctions.

One of the things the foreign minister has said in the past is he said he wants the U.S. to go back into the nuclear agreement as well. But, of course, judging by what we're hearing from the White House and some of President Trump's advisers, that does not look like it's something that would be in the cards anytime soon.

Meanwhile, as far as that new intelligence is concerned, we've not heard any denials coming here out of Tehran yet since we found out about that alleged intelligence. However, the Iranian ambassador to the U.N. -- he gave an interview, which has come out on Iranian state media, where he said look, the Iranians are not looking to start any sort of conflict. They're not preparing for any conflict in the Persian Gulf region but they are preparing to defend themselves, they say.

[05:35:20] So the Iranians are essentially saying any sort of moves they're making right now in the Persian Gulf, defensive in nature, Christine.

ROMANS: All right. In Tehran, Fred Pleitgen for us. Thanks, Fred.

BRIGGS: Attorney General Bill Barr says explanations he's been given for the origin of the Russia probe, quote, "don't hang together." Barr telling Fox News during a visit to El Salvador that he has more questions today than when he first started investigating the investigation.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: People have to find out what the government was doing during that period. If we're -- if we're worried about foreign influence -- for the very same reason, we should be worried about whether government officials abuse their power and put their thumb on the scale. And so, I'm not saying that happened but I'm saying that we have to look at that.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BRIGGS: CNN reporting earlier this week that Barr has appointed a top federal prosecutor to look into the genesis of the Russia investigation. Barr has also enlisted the help of the CIA and director of national intelligence.

ROMANS: President Trump announcing his broad plan to reform border security and legal immigration, calling for changes that would favor young, educated immigrants instead of those with family ties to the United States.

The measure calls for a points-based system that would favor highly- skilled, financially self-sufficient immigrants who learn English and pass a civics exam.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: Random selection is contrary to American values. Under these senseless rules of the current system, we're not able to give preference to a doctor, a researcher, a student who graduated number one in his class from the finest colleges in the world.

We discriminate against genius. We discriminate against brilliance. We won't anymore once we get this passed.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROMANS: Trump cast the measure as a consensus plan that would solve one of Washington's most stubborn challenges. But the plan faces an uphill battle, even among Republicans. Democrats are all but certain to oppose it, calling the changes drastic and inhumane.

As expected, it does not propose any legal status for so-called Dreamers. Those are the young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. That issue remains unresolved.

BRIGGS: All right. So let's talk about it with "Washington Post" White House correspondent Toluse Olorunnipa. Good morning, sir.

ROMANS: Hi, there.

BRIGGS: Happy Friday.

TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE WASHINGTON POST: Good morning. Happy Friday.

BRIGGS: Let's start with that immigration proposal. What actually is it if it doesn't address DACA, and what's the reception among the Republican Party?

OLORUNNIPA: Yes, it's a little bit weird because this is basically a political document. This is something that the president can campaign on in 2020.

But it does not seem to have much support. Obviously, it does not have support from Democrats who have trashed it and said it's dead on arrival in Congress. But even some Republicans are saying it doesn't go far enough to restrict legal immigration. It doesn't do a number of the things that Republicans have called for in restricting immigration overall.

So it's sort of confusing as to why the White House would put this out knowing that it's not going to be able to move through Congress -- knowing that it's basically dead on arrival in a Congress that's led, in part, by Democrats.

And knowing that the president said that he was going to be able to bring Democrats and Republicans together -- bring everyone into a room and solve some of the thorny problems of the country -- it seems like he left Democrats out of the process and he's produced a policy that does not have support from any Democrats, and even is bleeding support from a number of Republicans.

ROMANS: Yes, there's a lot -- a lot they didn't touch there. You know, guest worker programs and DACA in particular, but other things as well.

There is a lot more specificity the president has been putting forward about what he wants his border wall to look like, Toluse.

BRIGGS: Yes.

ROMANS: You guys have some fantastic reporting in "The Washington Post."

For example, that he wants it to be -- he wants it to be painted flat black so it gets really hot. And he's very specific, tell us, about how sharp he wants the points to be and what kind of injuries people could sustain by trying to cross into the United States.

OLORUNNIPA: Yes, the president has been fixated on the design of the border wall. He's really thrown himself into this process in sort of calling for specific designs. He's called for the border wall to be painted back, something that border officials have said it would be costly and cause the cost of maintenance to go because once you paint a wall, you have to keep going back and repainting it, in part, because the president wants the wall to be intimidating. He wants it to be a deterrent.

He also called for there to be very pointy spikes at the top of this wall so that people would look at it and be afraid that they would get injured. And he's actually said that people would actually be injured as they try to get over the wall and that's something that he supports because he does not want as many people trying to cross the border as we've seen over the past few weeks.

So it's really interesting that the president has thrown himself so fully into the design of the border wall, even causing border officials to scramble, go back and forth, and change the design based on his personal whims. It's clear that the president is heavily involved in this and he's going to continue to be until he sees the wall that he wants.

[05:40:11] ROMANS: Sort of different than designing a golf course or a hotel lobby, but --

BRIGGS: Well, but --

ROMANS: -- he seems to be having that kind of a micromanager aspect.

BRIGGS: Hey, look, 100,000 apprehensions last month. This is, indeed, a crisis.

Let's turn back to the top story this morning, which is the confrontation with Iran. And miscommunication seems to sum it all up, both sides misreading one another.

And, Congress also seemed to be left in the dark at this point. Here's Lindsey Graham.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): I'm sure there's a good reason to do what they did. I have confidence in Sec. Pompeo and the national security team.

But I'm in charge of the State Department's funding and I'd like to know why we took the action we did. I think there are a lot of senators who feel like they're in the dark and they dropped the ball on this.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BRIGGS: Congress clearly left out of the conversation.

And, Toluse, you can't help but think much like the TPP might have helped us confront China with our allies, staying in the JCPOA -- or the Iran nuclear deal -- might have helped confront Iran.

What is the administration's goal here?

OLORUNNIPA: Well, it's not really clear what their goal is because we've heard an inconsistent message from the White House and they've put across an inconsistent message to the Congress. That's why you're hearing so much frustration from even Republican and Democratic members of Congress.

My sense is that the president does not want to be involved in another war, even if some of his advisers are preparing for that. The president has told some of his top officials that he does not want to get into a war with Iran -- that he wants to actually have talks with Iran.

So it may be something similar to what we saw with North Korea where the president sort of increases the tension between the two countries and then tries to have a meeting and then claims credit for staving off a war even if there's no peace deal in the end.

But it's clear the president would rather have diplomacy than war at this point, especially going into 2020. He knows that his base and his voters do not want to be involved in another long-term war in the Middle East.

BRIGGS: Yes.

OLORUNNIPA: So even if his advisers are pushing for that, he seems to be pulling them back from the brink, saying no war with Iran right now.

BRIGGS: And as with a lot of situations, kind of a good cop-bad cop dynamic with John Bolton, in this case, being the bad cop and the president the good cop. Kind of like North Korea, China, and others.

ROMANS: Yes.

BRIGGS: Toluse, good to see you, my friend. Have a great weekend.

ROMANS: Have a great weekend.

OLORUNNIPA: Thank you.

ROMANS: All right, 42 minutes past the hour.

This is what a trade war looks like. America's largest retailer, Walmart, says it will raise prices on some products because of President Trump's tariffs on China.

Its CFO, Brett Biggs, said Thursday, "We're going to continue to do everything we can to keep prices low. That's who we are. However, increased tariffs will lead to increased prices, we believe, for our customers."

He did not say which items will become more expensive but noted Walmart is working with its suppliers to manage the supply chain.

Here's what Kevin Hassett, though -- the president's chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers -- said last night about that Walmart announcement.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KEVIN HASSETT, CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS: -- on China.

ERIN BURNETT, CNN ANCHOR, "ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT": Wouldn't the CFO of Walmart know what he's talking about? I mean, I don't think the CFO of Walmart -- all I'm saying -- is go out and say prices are going to go up unless he looked at it and knew they were going to go up.

HASSETT: You go up and down the aisles, there's a million things. And, of course, there are going to be some products that don't have close substitutes, but a lot of them do. And then in the end, it's an empirical question, which is dominating?

And if you look at inflation in the U.S., it's been decelerating. And so I don't think that you could say that the tariffs have --

BURNETT: So you think he's got it wrong?

HASSETT: -- caused this spike.

BURNETT: OK. So, the president --

HASSETT: Yes, it's not in the data, what he's saying. It's not in the aggregate data, for sure.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROMANS: Downplaying, clearly, what everyone says is that at some point, big tariffs get passed on to consumers.

Look, Walmart isn't the only retailer warning that tariffs will hit customers. Macy's also said it will raise prices on some merchandise because of the trade war.

But on the other side of Trump's tariffs, Stanley Black and Decker announced plans to move production of its Craftsman wrenches out of China and back to the U.S., building a new plant in Fort Worth, Texas that will open in late 2020. Stanley said the Fort Worth plant will employ 500 full-time employees.

The company made a big point that it's going to be a more modern, technologically-advanced plant in Fort Worth than the one that it is evacuating, essentially, in China.

BRIGGS: Fewer jobs than --

ROMANS: Five hundred jobs and a lot of technology. And that's -- and with 25 percent tariffs, it now makes sense for them to make that move.

BRIGGS: Very interesting.

Ahead, new changes to the SAT has more to do with where you live instead of our actual academic performance. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[05:48:41] BRIGGS: An F-16 fighter jet crashing on take-off from March Air Reserve Base near Riverside, California. The plane slamming through the roof of a nearby warehouse.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That (expletive) airplane -- that's a military airplane in our building.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BRIGGS: Imagine that moment.

Air Force officials say a hydraulic failure led to the jet's crash. The pilot ejected before impact and had no injuries.

The CEO of the company in the warehouse says his employees are all safe, but Air Base officials say five people were injured on the ground. We've reached out for details on their conditions.

Changes are coming to the SAT exam. An adversity score is being added to the test. It will take into account a student's social and economic background.

The College Board that administers the SAT says it will be implementing an environmental context dashboard, which measures factors like the crime rate and poverty levels of a student's neighborhood.

The score will be rolled out to 150 schools this year and more widely in 2020. The idea is to better capture an applicant's resourcefulness to overcome challenges and achieve more with less.

The change comes as colleges face heightened scrutiny over the admissions process and the diversity of their student bodies.

ROMANS: Let's get a check on "CNN Business" this morning.

Global markets mostly lower here as trade tensions round out the week. On Wall Street, futures are pointing down a little bit here as well, which is a third of a percentage point. Stocks rose Thursday for three days in a row.

[05:50:07] The president is sending a delegation to China to resume trade talks. The president punted on global car tariffs, giving a 6- month window here to make that decision.

So, the Dow closed up 215 points. The S&P and the Nasdaq both ended the day a little bit higher as well.

Frankly, a day of no negative trade news is a small win for investors. And take a look -- all three major averages, for the record, are above where they were when this trade war began almost a year ago.

BRIGGS: Wow.

ROMANS: Just up a little bit. It's been up and down and in between but on balance, folks -- up a little bit.

One to watch here today, chipmakers. Nvidia's stock rose after posting strong first-quarter earnings. Stocks of other chipmakers, though, fell after the U.S. banned Huawei from selling telecom gear. Huawei buys chips from many of those companies.

Samsung's 5G phone is officially on the market. Its Galaxy S10 starts at $1,300. It's the first smartphone that can access 5G in the U.S. without an attachment.

Right now, the device is only available for Verizon customers in Chicago and Minneapolis, but it plans to launch phones in more cities on Verizon and work with other carriers.

Samsung now ahead of Apple, which is not expected to debut a 5G iPhone until the fourth quarter of 2020.

All right, do you hate making small talk with your Uber driver? Now you don't have to.

Uber announced new features for Uber Black and Uber Black SUV riders and one of them being quiet mode, describing the feature as, "If you need to respond to e-mails or are in the mood for a nap, make your trip a quieter one with just one tap."

Premium features also include help with luggage, temperature control, and extended pickup periods.

I would like aromatherapy -- a little bit of lavender, eucalyptus, and don't talk to me.

BRIGGS: You'd like to use the mute feature at home and at other places.

ROMANS: And here.

BRIGGS: My daughter does that with me with headphones. That mutes me.

ROMANS: Don't talk to me.

BRIGGS: All right. This week marks the end of a television era on two fronts. More on the finales for two favorites, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

[05:56:37] BRIGGS: The Rolling Stones ready to get back on the road. The band announcing rescheduled dates for its No Filter Tour will kick off June 21st at Soldier Field in Chicago.

The news comes a day after Mick Jagger posted a video of himself rehearsing his trademark dance moves a little over a month after his heart surgery. The procedure forced the Stones to postpone the North American leg of their tour.

ROMANS: So, this week marks the end of a T.V. era.

The finale episode of "GAME OF THRONES" airs Sunday night on HBO with only one of those dragons. And the eighth and final season of the megahit series has been a ratings bonanza. Last week's penultimate episode set yet another record with more than 18 million viewers tuning in.

BRIGGS: And there was laughter and tears during the series finale of "THE BIG BANG THEORY."

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JIM PARSONS, ACTOR, CBS "THE BIG BANG THEORY": I want you to know, in my way, I love you all.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BRIGGS: The CBS sitcom ended its 12-season run Thursday with a 1-hour finale that wrapped up several long-running storylines. At 279 episodes, "THE BIG BANG THEORY" is the longest-running, multi-camera series in television history. We'll miss you, Sheldon.

ROMANS: All right. The late-night hosts have some theories about New York Mayor Bill de Blasio's presidential run. Check it out.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JIMMY FALLON, HOST, NBC, "THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON": Well, you guys, after 12 years, today was the final episode of "THE BIG BANG THEORY" -- yes. Don't worry, it was also the beginning of a brand new comedy, "Bill de Blasio's Presidential Campaign."

SETH MEYERS, HOST, NBC "LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS": New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced today that he is running for president. Come on, Bill, everyone knows the next step after mayor of New York is insane lawyer.

STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, CBS "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT": Yet another new Democratic candidate pushed his way into the clown car. I'm talking about New York City mayor and Frankenstein's monster's lawyer, Bill de Blasio. You hear the hometown crowd warmly receiving that.

JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, ABC "JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!": At this point, announcing you're running for president is like announcing you're running a 5K. Good for you, no one cares. Don't post pictures.

There are now 23 Democrats in the race and unless one of these guys has a dragon we don't know about, I don't know how any of them come out of this alive.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROMANS: Oh, I like the "GAME OF THRONES" reference. BRIGGS: The hometown papers here in New York not so friendly, either. Here's the "Daily News" -- "Escape From New York -- Leaving New York Even More Rudderless."

ROMANS: And, "The Nation Unites to Oppose Blas for President -- Black Lives Matters, Police, Community Activist, and Whoopi Goldberg."

BRIGGS: Welcome to the race, Bill de Blasio.

ROMANS: Thanks for joining us. Have a great weekend, everybody. I'm Christine Romans.

BRIGGS: I'm Dave Briggs. Here's "NEW DAY." See you Monday.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BRIGGS: Was the escalation between the U.S. and Iran one big misunderstanding?

BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: U.S. officials have images they assess shows that Iranian freighters are carrying missiles.

REPORTER: Are we going to war with Iran?

Walmart Faces New Round of Gender    Discrimination  Suits

The ghost of Betty Dukes still haunts the aisles of Walmart Inc.—and the halls of Walmart's legal department, which is having to deal with the latest round of gender discrimination lawsuits.

Dukes, the former Walmart worker who died last July, led 1.5 million women into a class action lawsuit on gender discrimination in 2001, only to see the U.S. Supreme Court toss it on a technical ruling over procedure, not on the merits, in 2011.

Now in the footsteps of Dukes, several hundred women across a dozen states or more are filing individual discrimination suits against Walmart, according to Christine Webber, a civil rights lawyer and partner with Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll in Washington, D.C.

The law firm was co-lead counsel on the Dukes class action and is now helping to coordinate the state suits with local law firms.

Webber, who worked nine years on the Dukes case, told Legal affiliate Corporate Counsel on Tuesday the new suits represent the first of 1,800 women, most of whom were part of the original Dukes action. They are claiming discrimination in pay and promotions at the world's largest retailer.

"We have unfinished business that we are determined to see through to the end," she said. "We have really tremendous clients who have been sticking with their claims for many years."

Randy Hargrove, Walmart's senior director of national media relations, said the company plans to defend against the gender bias claims.

"Walmart has had a strong policy against discrimination in place for many years and we continue to be a great place for women to work and advance," Hargrove said. "In fact last year, 57% of our U.S. hourly promotions were women as were 43% of U.S. management promotions."

Walmart has enacted a model diversity program that especially impacted its inhouse legal department, which grew from a handful of women lawyers in 1998 to 42% in 2005 and 46% a year ago.

In addition, its chief legal officer and group general counsel are female, as are six of 14 division general counsel. That includes this month's appointment of Jeanine Jiganti to the new position of general counsel for health and wellness.

The changes have not stopped the plaintiffs. Webber said complaints alleging gender discrimination already have been filed through local law firms in six states: Florida, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, with more expected this week in Ohio and California. They total 19 cases involving 150 female plaintiffs so far.

Some are suing alone, she said, while others are in small groups who shared work situations, such as the same regions or managers. "The jury will still be asked about each individual and not the group," Webber explained.

Preparations are underway for suits in five more states: Alabama, Iowa, Illinois, Mississippi and Texas in the coming months, she added. There will probably be more beyond that, she said.

Webber has worked at Cohen Milstein for 21 years. In the Dukes case, she said she was heavily involved in taking depositions and coordinating discovery. Later she said she was one of a four-person team that drafted the Dukes class certification brief.

Reversing a lower court, the Supreme Court ruled the group was too expansive and there were too many differences among members to be certified as a class.

Before Cohen Milstein, Webber worked as an in-house counsel for four years at the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights & Urban Affairs from 1993 to 1997.

After Dukes, she helped bring regional class action suits against Walmart on behalf of smaller groups of women. As they neared oral arguments, the Supreme Court ruled in an unrelated case that the statute of limitations could bar these class actions, though not individual suits.

"Procedural hurdles continued to be put before our clients," Webber said, but the 1,800 women and their lawyers regrouped again. They won their right to sue letters from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and began bringing actions one by one.

Hargrove said the plaintiffs' allegations are more than 15 years old "and are not representative of the positive experiences millions of women have had working at Walmart."

He said Walmart outpaces the current S&P 500 female representation at the corporate officer level. Women represent 32% of corporate officers at Walmart while the S&P 500 average is 27%, he said.

Hargrove also said women represent 25% of the Walmart board, outpacing the S&P 500 average of 21%.

He added since 2016 more than 800,000 Walmart associates have gone through a special training academy, with 60% of them being women. "We are committed to creating a performance culture where associates are rewarded based on meaningful factors such as qualifications, experience [and] performance," he said.

Webber conceded that most of the claims are based on pre-2010 Walmart behavior.

"I'm certainly not suggesting that there has been no change," she said. "Walmart has made changes in practices and increased the number of women in management. But it's still not where we would expect it to be."

Walmart's legal team is apparently being led by Littler Mendelson, according to Webber, who said she saw that law firm defending Walmart in the regional suits and continues to see it in the state actions.

Hargrove said Walmart generally does not discuss its outside counsel, and Littler managing director Thomas Bender wouldn't comment. He directed calls to Jennifer Klein, director of public relations, who did not return the message.

Demise of Walmart 'greeters' reveals shortcomings in the Americans with Disabilities Act

Back in 2015, the retailer began experimenting with a new position it called “hosts” to replace the employee who traditionally greeted customers entering a store. The new position, however, required the ability to lift 25 pounds, clean up spills and stand for long periods of time – duties that would be difficult or impossible for many greeters with a disability.

After a public backlash, Walmart said it would give greeters with disabilities extra support and time to find a new job in the company.

The change took final effect late last month. Former greeters who weren’t given a new position – which Walmart earlier had estimated at as many as 20% – were to be terminated with severance. Walmart didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Some disabled greeters who have already lost their jobs over the past couple years as part of the shift have filed claims with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging that they were not offered a “reasonable accommodation” under the ADA.

While the outcome of their cases remains unclear, my research has shown that the reality is that the ADA – and how courts interpret it – offers companies like Walmart several ways to legally avoid accommodating disabled workers, a group with persistently high unemployment rates.

What employers may not realize is the mistake they’re making when they do this.

https://images.theconversation.com/files/273684/original/file-20190509-183093-1q94d7l.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&fit=clip

‘Reasonable acommodations’

Perhaps the most visible signs of the ADA, passed in 1990, are the ramps and handicap parking spaces that have proliferated next to curbs and offices throughout the country.

The ADA, however, was intended to do a lot more to provide people with physical and mental limitations job opportunities. A key element involved an employer’s responsibility to offer “reasonable accommodations” to enable a person with a disability to carry out his or her duties, such as by modifying a work schedule, providing technological aids or transferring the worker to another position that he or she can perform.

The one caveat was if “doing so would pose an undue hardship” for the employer, meaning it would require significant difficulty or expense. What that meant in practice was left up to the courts to decide.

Employer discretion

In its early years, the ADA only moderately increased the availability of accommodations in the workplace. And when workers sued, more than 90% of cases were decided in favor of employers.

That’s because courts have generally deferred to employers in determining how to comply with the law.

Courts relied heavily on formal job descriptions and the employer’s judgment when interpreting essential job duties, limiting the rights of people with disabilities to obtain accommodations.

For example, employers might deny a transfer as an accommodation by claiming another applicant for that position is better qualified to fill the role. The discretion granted to employers in determining who is better qualified means that companies can refuse to provide a transfer even when termination is the only alternative.

Assumptions and stigmas

Another goal of the ADA was to prevent employers from stigmatizing people with disabilities.

But research I co-authored in 2018 examined how courts have permitted employers to rely on assumptions and stereotypes about what a person with disabilities is capable of when denying an accommodation request. This is of particular concern for people with a psychological or intellectual impairment, who are often deemed unqualified based on a diagnosis alone.

For example, an employer can require mental health as a job requirement. That assumption – that someone with a mental health disorder such as bipolar disorder is fundamentally incapable of performing a specific task – makes it difficult for an applicant to show he or she is qualified for a job, with or without an accommodation.

Or an employer could intentionally define a job so as to disqualify people with disabilities. In 2005, Walmartproposed that all jobs require some physical activity to reduce the number of unhealthy job applicants and lower its health care costs.

But intentional discrimination is hard to prove, particularly when an employer retains the discretion to define essential job duties.

Missing an opportunity

Although Congress amended the ADA in 2008 to broaden the definition of who is covered, I’ve found that these changes didn’t do anything to ensure employers actually provide “reasonable accommodations” to their disabled workers. Instead, employers can still rely on generalized assumptions about what they’re qualified to do based on a diagnosis or past behavior.

While the Supreme Court has called on companies to analyze the abilities of each individual employee or job applicant rather than rely on assumptions, lower courts continue to allow employers to do just that.

One fix is for Congress to tighten the definition of when an accommodation is reasonable, rather then allowing companies to decide for themselves. Unfortunately, I don’t see that happening anytime soon, and individual courts will interpret the act however they like.

But even without further tweaks to the ADA, there’s a strong case to be made that employers should be willing to do more to hire and retain people with disabilities, particularly in such a tight labor market. Research shows that these workers tend to perform well and remain loyal to employers who treat them with respect.

Not only that, accommodating a good worker rather than firing her reduces turnover costs.

If companies finally see the light, workplaces may eventually become as accessible to the disabled as public buildings.

MIL-OSI Global: Demise of Walmart ‘greeters’ reveals shortcomings in the Americans with Disabilities Act

Walmart’s decision to eliminate the "greeter" position in all its stores is a case study of why the Americans with Disabilities Act is falling short of its original vision.

Back in 2015, the retailer began experimenting with a new position it called "hosts" to replace the employee who traditionally greeted customers entering a store.

The new position, however, required the ability to lift 25 pounds, clean up spills and stand for long periods of time - duties that would be difficult or impossible for many greeters with a disability.

After a public backlash, Walmart said it would give greeters with disabilities extra support and time to find a new job in the company.

The change took final effect late last month. Former greeters who weren’t given a new position - which Walmart earlier had estimated at as many as 20% - were to be terminated with severance. Walmart didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Some disabled greeters who have already lost their jobs over the past couple years as part of the shift have filed claims with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging that they were not offered a "reasonable accommodation" under the ADA.

While the outcome of their cases remains unclear, my research has shown that the reality is that the ADA - and how courts interpret it - offers companies like Walmart several ways to legally avoid accommodating disabled workers, a group with persistently high unemployment rates.

What employers may not realize is the mistake they’re making when they do this.

‘Reasonable acommodations’

Perhaps the most visible signs of the ADA, passed in 1990, are the ramps and handicap parking spaces that have proliferated next to curbs and offices throughout the country.

The ADA, however, was intended to do a lot more to provide people with physical and mental limitations job opportunities. A key element involved an employer’s responsibility to offer "reasonable accommodations" to enable a person with a disability to carry out his or her duties, such as by modifying a work schedule, providing technological aids or transferring the worker to another position that he or she can perform.

The one caveat was if "doing so would pose an undue hardship" for the employer, meaning it would require significant difficulty or expense. What that meant in practice was left up to the courts to decide.

Employer discretion

In its early years, the ADA only moderately increased the availability of accommodations in the workplace. And when workers sued, more than 90% of cases were decided in favor of employers.

That’s because courts have generally deferred to employers in determining how to comply with the law.

Courts relied heavily on formal job descriptions and the employer’s judgment when interpreting essential job duties, limiting the rights of people with disabilities to obtain accommodations.

For example, employers might deny a transfer as an accommodation by claiming another applicant for that position is better qualified to fill the role. The discretion granted to employers in determining who is better qualified means that companies can refuse to provide a transfer even when termination is the only alternative.

Assumptions and stigmas

EXCHANGE --- Technology -- Keywords: A Problem Is Building at Amazon: Its Size --- Branching out, the juggernaut is getting embroiled in controversies from Echo to cloud; a Twitter war with Elizabeth Warren

Amazon.com Inc. has a Facebook Inc.-size problem: It's become such a sprawling business that its inevitable missteps are beginning to erode trust in its products and services, good will in Washington, and its ability to achieve globe-spanning dominance.

Let's pause to reflect that the company that has made one-day shipping of tens of millions of items the industry standard is also the global leader in cloud computing services, owns the Whole Foods grocery stores, helps police departments identify criminals, is building its own air cargo fleet, has an $11 billion-a-year advertising business, is working on giving everyone on Earth internet from space, has put always-on microphones in at least 1 in 10 U.S. homes, built an Oscar-winning film and TV studio from scratch, and is competing directly with UPS, FedEx, Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, IBM, the entire book-publishing industry, Netflix, HBO, Disney, Walmart, Target, CVS, Walgreens and countless startups.

Phew.

The breadth of Amazon's ambitions and its mounting problems are linked.

Amazon is embroiled in controversies over the use of its facial-recognition software, the treatment of both its warehouse workers and its delivery drivers, whether its talking speakers violate child-protection rules, how much it is really lowering prices at Whole Foods, and whether or not its Ring doorbell-camera subsidiary is protecting users' privacy. In the past month, the company got into a very public Twitter spat with Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, rebutted reports that it fires warehouse employees through an app and denied that it dismissed seven workers on account of their pregnancies. Before that, the company had to start accepting cash at its cashless stores in order to avoid discrimination, and address allegations its employees listen to recordings from Echo devices. And then of course there was the time Amazon decided not to locate its HQ2 in New York City, after local and state politicians called the company so toxic they'd rather not host a massive economic stimulus.

"When you're a disrupter, you have flexibility you don't have as a leader," says Alice Fournier, vice president of e-commerce at the research company Kantar.

One oft-repeated line -- brought up frequently by Amazon executives and cited in Jeff Bezos' most recent letter to shareholders -- is that Amazon is less than 4% of U.S. retail. That's a smaller share than Walmart.

"The retail market is fiercely competitive, and we have competitors who are larger than us in every country where we operate," says an Amazon spokesman. "The vast majority of U.S. retail sales -- 90% -- still occur in physical stores," he adds.

What you'll never see Amazon citing are other statistics showing that Amazon is half of all U.S. e-commerce. Or that, as Kantar estimates, about 50% of U.S. households have an Amazon Prime membership, and of those, about half shop on Amazon weekly. Or, of course, that its e-commerce distribution infrastructure is far larger than that of any competitor.

Some experts in antitrust law agree that Amazon doesn't meet the bar for interest from regulators. "Amazon's size per se is not something I am worried about," says Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale University economist who served in the Justice Department's antitrust division under Barack Obama. "Anticompetitive conduct is what harms consumers, and that is what critics should be showing."

In 2017, Lina Khan, a legal scholar and now an adviser to the House Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law, published a paper in the Yale Law Journal, "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox," that has since become hugely influential.

Rejecting the framing that the only measure of whether a company is a harmful monopoly is when it unfairly raises prices, Ms. Khan argued that definitions of monopoly from the early 1900s should be revived. By its very bigness, Amazon stifles competition, she argued.

Mr. Bezos proudly touts the fact that the majority of retail sales on Amazon now come from sellers paying Amazon to use its infrastructure. While this relatively high-margin business might please investors, it also creates a feedback loop in which more people start their search for goods on Amazon.

"The thousands of retailers and independent businesses that must ride Amazon's rails to reach market are increasingly dependent on their biggest competitor," Ms. Khan wrote.

But far from Amazon eating all of retail, the existential threat it represents has inspired its rivals to invest. Now, at least some are leveraging technology to play to their core strengths, whether that's Walmart's role as a grocer and mass retailer, or Target's strategy of focusing on smaller-format stores and in-store pickup.

Amazon is also beginning to demonstrate a willingness to partner as well as compete. In 2018, Kohl's Chief Executive Michelle Gass told the Journal that her company was happy it had partnered with Amazon to accept returns for the internet giant. "There is a lot of space for both of us," she said at the time.

Hingeto, a startup launched by the Y Combinator accelerator program, promises to help its customers create their own Amazon-style marketplace in miniature, taking care of everything from fulfillment to payments.

The idea is that while no one company can match Amazon's infrastructure, a large number of vendors banded together could give third-party fulfillment providers the ability to offer two-day shipping at a reasonable price. Pair that with off-the-shelf storefront software and payments handled by companies like Stripe, and each custom marketplace can sell its own set of specialty items, while behind it all is one giant collective operation operated by companies other than Amazon.

Amazon has one ace up its sleeve that none of its competitors can match: the vast quantities of data it collects.

As it builds out its targeted-advertising operation and continues to grow its list of corporate frenemies, that data will be a point of ever greater concern. When Amazon not only provides your on-demand videos, toiletries and home furnishings but also the cloud service your doctor uses to analyze your medical records, you might think twice about buying that pint of gelato at Whole Foods.

Amazon is embroiled in controversies over the use of its facial-recognition software, the treatment of both its warehouse workers and its delivery drivers, whether its talking speakers violate child-protection rules, how much it is really lowering prices at Whole Foods, and whether or not its Ring doorbell-camera subsidiary is protecting users' privacy. In the past month, the company got into a very public Twitter spat with Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who has proposed breaking up Amazon, rebutted reports that it fires warehouse employees through an app, and denied that it dismissed seven workers on account of their pregnancies. Before that, the company had to start accepting cash at its cashless stores in order to avoid discrimination, and address allegations its employees listen to recordings from Echo devices.

"When you're a disrupter, you have flexibility you don't have as a leader," says Alice Fournier, vice president of e-commerce at the research and consulting company Kantar.

Amazon's preferred view was once more widely held: that it is an engine of growth, a triumph of American free markets and a customer-obsessed innovator. Now, when it enters a new business, not only do competitors grow wary but politicians take note. What was once the "Walmart effect" on competitors, supply chains, labor markets and Main Street U.S.A. is now the "Amazon effect."

How Big Is Too Big?

One oft-repeated line—brought up frequently by Amazon executives and cited in Jeff Bezos' most recent letter to shareholders—is that Amazon is less than 1% of global retail, or less than 4% of U.S. retail. That's a smaller share than Walmart.

"The retail market is fiercely competitive, and we have competitors who are larger than us in every country where we operate," says an Amazon spokesman. "The vast majority of U.S. retail sales—90%—still occur in physical stores," he adds.

Or that, as Kantar estimates, about 50% of U.S. households have an Amazon Prime membership, and of those, about half shop on Amazon weekly. Or, of course, that its e-commerce distribution infrastructure is far larger than that of any competitor.

Growth in its revenue may be slowing, but it's still unparalleled among retailers of its size. In its most recent quarter, the company's revenue grew 17% compared with a year before.

Some experts in antitrust law agree that Amazondoesn't meet the bar for interest from regulators. "Amazon's size per se is not something I am worried about, and size generally is not something economists worry about," says Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale University economist who served in the Justice Department's antitrust division under Barack Obama. "Anticompetitive conduct is what harms consumers, and that is what critics should be showing."

There are other legal scholars and potential regulators—epitomized by Sen. Warren—who are thinking in new ways about whether or not Amazon harms consumers or competition through its size. In 2017, Lina Khan, a legal scholar and now an adviser to the House Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law, published a paper in the Yale Law Journal, "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox," that has since become hugely influential.

Rejecting the framing that dominates current antitrust law, that the only measure of whether a company is a harmful monopoly is when it unfairly raises prices, Ms. Khan argued that definitions of monopoly from the bygone era of trustbusting in the early 1900s should be revived.

Mr. Bezos proudly touts the fact that the majority of retail sales on Amazon now come from sellers paying Amazon to use its infrastructure. While this relatively high-margin business might please investors, it also creates a feedback loop in which more people start their search for goods on Amazon, which in turn forces ever more (often reluctant) brands and retailers to be on Amazon's platform.

"The thousands of retailers and independent businesses that must ride Amazon's rails to reach market are increasingly dependent on their biggest competitor," Ms. Khan wrote.

Fighting for Their Lives

At first, Amazon's competitors tried copying it directly, and that didn't work out, says Ms. Fournier at Kantar. But far from Amazon eating all of retail, the existential threat it represents has inspired its rivals to invest. Now, at least some are leveraging technology to play to their core strengths, whether that's Walmart's role as a grocer and mass retailer, or Target's strategy of focusing on smaller-format stores and in-store pickup.

In 2017, Target pledged to spend $7 billion in capital over three years revamping its stores and an additional $1 billion a year from its profits to innovate and discover new, defensible moats, or unique advantages.

Amazon is also beginning to demonstrate a willingness to partner as well as compete. In 2018, Kohl's Chief Executive Michelle Gasstold the Journal that her company was happy it had partnered with Amazon to accept returns for the internet giant. "There is a lot of space for both of us," she said at the time.

Amazon's preferred view was once more widely held: that it is an engine of growth, a triumph of American free markets and a customer-obsessed innovator. Now, when it enters a new business, not only do competitors grow wary but politicians take note. What was once the "Walmart effect" on competitors, supply chains, labor markets and Main Street U.S.A. is now the " Amazon effect."

How Big Is Too Big?

One oft-repeated line -- brought up frequently by Amazon executives and cited in Jeff Bezos' most recent letter to shareholders -- is that Amazon is less than 1% of global retail, or less than 4% of U.S. retail. That's a smaller share than Walmart.

"The retail market is fiercely competitive, and we have competitors who are larger than us in every country where we operate," says an Amazon spokesman. "The vast majority of U.S. retail sales -- 90% -- still occur in physical stores," he adds.

What you'll never see Amazon citing are other statistics showing that Amazon is half of all U.S. e-commerce. Or that, as Kantar estimates, about 50% of U.S. households have an Amazon Prime membership, and of those, about half shop on Amazon weekly. Or, of course, that its e-commerce distribution infrastructure is far larger than that of any competitor.

Growth in its revenue may be slowing, but it's still unparalleled among retailers of its size. In its most recent quarter, the company's revenue grew 17% compared with a year before.

Some experts in antitrust law agree that Amazon doesn't meet the bar for interest from regulators. "Amazon's size per se is not something I am worried about, and size generally is not something economists worry about," says Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale University economist who served in the Justice Department's antitrust division under Barack Obama. "Anticompetitive conduct is what harms consumers, and that is what critics should be showing."

There are other legal scholars and potential regulators -- epitomized by Sen. Warren -- who are thinking in new ways about whether or not Amazon harms consumers or competition through its size. In 2017, Lina Khan, a legal scholar and now an adviser to the House Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law, published a paper in the Yale Law Journal, "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox," that has since become hugely influential.

Rejecting the framing that dominates current antitrust law, that the only measure of whether a company is a harmful monopoly is when it unfairly raises prices, Ms. Khan argued that definitions of monopoly from the bygone era of trustbusting in the early 1900s should be revived. By its very bigness, Amazon stifles competition, she argued.

Mr. Bezos proudly touts the fact that the majority of retail sales on Amazon now come from sellers paying Amazon to use its infrastructure. While this relatively high-margin business might please investors, it also creates a feedback loop in which more people start their search for goods on Amazon, which in turn forces ever more (often reluctant) brands and retailers to be on Amazon's platform.

"The thousands of retailers and independent businesses that must ride Amazon's rails to reach market are increasingly dependent on their biggest competitor," Ms. Khan wrote.

Fighting for Their Lives

At first, Amazon's competitors tried copying it directly, and that didn't work out, says Ms. Fournier at Kantar. But far from Amazon eating all of retail, the existential threat it represents has inspired its rivals to invest. Now, at least some are leveraging technology to play to their core strengths, whether that's Walmart's role as a grocer and mass retailer, or Target's strategy of focusing on smaller-format stores and in-store pickup.

In 2017, Target pledged to spend $7 billion in capital over three years revamping its stores and an additional $1 billion a year from its profits to innovate and discover new, defensible moats, or unique advantages.

Amazon is also beginning to demonstrate a willingness to partner as well as compete. In 2018, Kohl's Chief Executive Michelle Gass told the Journal that her company was happy it had partnered with Amazon to accept returns for the internet giant. "There is a lot of space for both of us," she said at the time.

Smaller competitors are looking for lessons for rapid growth. Hingeto, a startup recently launched by the Y Combinator accelerator program, promises to help its customers create their own Amazon-style marketplace in miniature, taking care of everything from fulfillment to payments.

The idea is that while no one company can match the scale of Amazon's infrastructure, a large number of vendors banded together could give third-party fulfillment providers the ability to offer two-day shipping at a reasonable price. Pair that with off-the-shelf storefront software and payments handled by companies like Stripe, and each custom marketplace can sell its own set of specialty items, while behind it all is one giant collective operation operated by companies other than Amazon.

Amazon has one ace up its sleeve that none of its competitors can match: the vast quantities of data it collects. Loyalty programs have long been a way for companies to track customers' habits, but Amazon's data-gathering operation is producing a trove that even Mark Zuckerberg might find impressive.

As it builds out its targeted-advertising operation and continues to grow its list of corporate frenemies, that data will be a point of ever greater concern. When Amazon not only provides your on-demand videos, toiletries and home furnishings but also the cloud service your doctor uses to analyze your medical records, you might think twice about buying that pint of gelato at Whole Foods.

US Accuses India Of    Discrimination  Against Walmart, Mastercard; 'Warns' Of Severe Consequences

India's 'Make in India' reform, designed to benefit the producers and suppliers of the Indian soil, has been repeatedly modified, creating thorny issues in trade relations between India and the US. Addressing the same issue on trade delegation, the US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, in his 3 day visit to India to participate in a US-government sponsored trade forum has been at bilateral talks with the Commerce minister Suresh Prabhu, the finance minister and PM Modi.

The trade imbalance between the two countries is increasing, which can pose as a serious problem, considering US to be the largest source of FDI in India. Ross accuses India of imposing restrictive trade policies that creates growth barriers on US companies operating in India. In his meeting with PM Modi, Ross mentioned that the US wanted India to eliminate trade barriers for American firms and remove restrictions related to data localisation.

Ross says that American companies have fully supported and cooperated towards Make in India and other such Indian programs but there has to be a limit on the discriminatory behaviour, else it might worry investors to invest in India. India's exports to the US in 2017-18 stood at $47.9 billion, while India imported goods worth $ 26.6 billion during the year. Ross said there was a "real imbalance" in bilateral trade.

In February, the Indian government laid down more regulations for the ecommerce sector, focusing on data localisation. This action led the RBI to push payments providers such as Mastercard and Visa Inc to store Indian users' data locally.

Several foreign companies have faced trouble in selling in Asia's third largest economy. Ross showcased his worries on letting India allow a fair playing field to let American companies compete in the Indian markets.

Ross believes that the whole case of Walmart after their acquisition of Flipkart is an important issue. Walmart is continuing to expand in India. Similarly with MasterCard, there are problems with data localisation when MasterCard is still continuing to invest.

The new Indian reform that came into effect Feb 1, barred online retailers such as Flipkart and Amazon from selling products of companies in which they own stakes, in the best interest of local offline retailers. The government also banned ecommerce companies from forming exclusive selling arrangements with sellers or offer steep discounts to consumers based on those deals, on December last year.

The RBI too, on October 16 initiated a new regulation wherein, the payment companies were to store all the data related to Indian customers within the country, focusing on data localisation, improved privacy safeguards and measures to combat the sale of counterfeit products. This posed a major downfall to all the payment firms, including Mastercard, Visa, American Express and PayPal.

The Trump administration, highly unhappy with these rules, announced that it has withdrawn the GSP benefits for India, which will come into action from May 1, 2019, calling India 'Tariff King'. Industry participants feel Ross's visit should also be an opportunity for the Indian government to discuss trade and tariff issues with the US administration, considering how important US is for Indian trade. With trade problems already ongoing with China, India must surely sort out its trade differences with the US before things get ugly.

Carol Whitmire worked at Walmart for 8 years, then her employer discovered she used medical marijuana; One woman’s story reveals the tricky legal terrain surrounding medical marijuana and workplace protections

One woman’s story reveals the tricky legal terrain surrounding medical marijuana and workplace protections

One woman’s story reveals the tricky legal terrain surrounding medical marijuana and workplace protections

Carol Whitmire liked her job as a customer service supervisor in a Walmart store in Taylor, Arizona, but it all starting falling apart the day a bag of ice fell on her wrist. That seemingly random accident unleashed a series of events that ended up in her firing and filing a wrongful termination lawsuit.

Around six years after starting work at Walmart (WMT, US), first as a cashier at another store, Whitmire, 61, obtained a state-issued medical marijuana card to treat lasting pain from arthritis and an old shoulder surgery.

In May 2016, that bag of ice fell on Whitmire’s right wrist as she leveled bags in the ice machine. She finished her shift, but the pain and swelling continued for several days. She was sent to an urgent-care clinic by Walmart.

At the clinic, her wrist was X-rayed and she took a urine test. No one at the clinic took her medical marijuana card, so Whitmire — anticipating that her employer would know that she had marijuana in her system — told her supervisor that she uses the drug for medical purposes.

Two months later, she was fired, with her positive drug test cited as the reason.

Experts say cases such as Whitmire’s exist in a legal grey area. Employee protections vary across the 34 states and the District of Columbia where medical marijuana is legal. Adult recreational use is also legal in 10 states and Washington D.C., but federal law still deems marijuana an illegal controlled substance.

“It really is a patchwork,” said Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML, an organization pushing to fully legalize marijuana.

An estimated 2.5 million people use medical marijuana, according to David Mangone, government affairs director at Americans for Safe Access, an advocacy organization pushing for medical marijuana user protections.

Company rules can be very strict about medical marijuana use for “safety sensitive” like coal miners, pilots, electrical workers, emergency medical technicians and police officers, he noted. “There’s not a state in country that prohibits employers from creating their own drug testing policies,” he said.

Whitmire appears to have been unlucky. Walmart had changed its drug abuse policies to specifically forbid workers from showing up on the job “under the influence of drugs or alcohol, including medical marijuana,” according to court papers.

She sued for wrongful termination and Arizona District Court Judge James Teilborg decided in February that Walmart was liable for discrimination under the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act. In late March, the parties settled for an undisclosed amount, ahead of any damages proceedings.

Tricky legal terrain surrounding marijuana use and workplace rules

“The judge’s order helped both parties come to a mutually satisfactory outcome,” Whitmire’s lawyer, Joshua Carden, said. “It’s a settlements that my client was happy with.”

As Judge Teilborg’s decision noted, Arizona and eight other states with medicinal marijuana laws have “explicit anti-discrimination protections from adverse employment actions.”

A Walmart spokesman said, “We work every day to create and maintain a safe environment for our associates and customers. We’re pleased we could resolve the matter with Ms. Whitmire.”

Even in states with protections, they are “limited,” said Mangone. A medical marijuana card was a “signficant asset,” he said, but they’re not an “absolute defense to wrongful discrimination.”

Last month, the drug testing company Quest Diagnostics(DGX, US)  said the rates of positive drug tests hit a 14-year high in 2018. Marijuana was the most commonly detected substance, according to the national drug testing company.

The presence of marijuana’s high-inducing THC in a urine test doesn’t necessarily mean impairment, the company notes. The chemical can linger for up to a month with a test for a habitual user, it said.

A proposed law in New York City would bar pre-employment drug tests for marijuana, with exceptions for jobs like heavy machine operators and first responders. It breezed through the City Council and Mayor Bill de Blasio supports the measure, a spokesman said.

Mangone said if workers feel they can trust their employer about off-duty medical marijuana use, he said it was important they have “an ongoing conversation, so there are no surprises on either side.” But the presence of trust between staff and management is hardly a given. Indeed, Whitmire’s case showed the perils of speaking up.

Whitmire didn’t bring marijuana to work, or use it during business hours, but she took it before bed at night and helped her manage her pain, she said. Whitmire preferred marijuana to prescribed painkillers like hydrocodone, which is considered an opioid.

Whitmire is now working as a convenience store cashier. She has debts and medical bills, but otherwise says she’s doing alright. “Don’t get fired, and try and find a job, not at 60,” she said. “Ten months unemployed was a killer, psychologically as well as financially.”

Walmart Inc. wants to change how its work gets done.

The nation's biggest private employer is testing out a comprehensive new framework for how its stores operate, including changing some roles and responsibilities and emphasizing teamwork, accountability and skill improvement. The new model, dubbed "Great Workplace," is already in place in about 75 locations, primarily its smaller Neighborhood Market grocery stores, and will expand to certain departments in more than 50 of its massive supercentre locations next month.

The new model will include pay raises for some hourly and salaried supervisors, who will shoulder more leadership responsibility in return. Staffers lower on the totem pole will receive more training, additional support from managers and better recognition for jobs well done.

"Associates like smaller teams, and they like having a connection with a leader. They want something they can own and to know if they are winning or losing every day. And today that does not always happen," Drew Holler, U.S. senior vice-president of associate experience, said in an interview.

The goal is to improve Walmart's reputation as an employer, which has been under attack for decades from labour activists and has spawned a spate of lawsuits accusing the retailer of everything from gender and age discrimination to not paying employees during breaks in their shifts.

Store managers remain at the top of the new structure, but under them will be about a half-dozen "Business Leads," who will manage the store's finances and all hiring efforts, among other duties. Their salaries will start about 10-per-cent higher than what assistant store managers currently make, according to a Walmart spokesman. Reporting to them will be "Team Leads," whose pay starts at US$18 an hour. They'll supervise groups of eight to 10 front-line associates.

Supercentre locations will be comprised of about 15 to 20 teams, each with one "Academy Trainer," who will work to "upskill" employees and make sure they "understand the correct way to perform their jobs," according to internal documents viewed by Bloomberg. The role is a way to bring the company's network of training academies, which today primarily teach only supervisors, to the rank and file.

Every store in the program will receive a "toolkit" with magnetic boards, used to assign employees individual responsibility - Walmart calls it "ownership" - for specific areas of the store, like the wall of prepackaged salads. The kit also includes "Attitude Cards" that managers will carry around with them during shifts, so they can remind staffers of the four behaviours promoted by the program: Be bold, be an owner, be open and be kind.

Employees who perform well will earn "stars" - multiple blue stars can be exchanged for a silver star, and silvers can lead to a gold. Those who get gold stars will receive a reward set by store leadership, which could include lunch with the store manager, according to the company documents. Some employees have bristled at the star system, calling it childish.

(Bloomberg)—Walmart Inc. wants to change how its work gets done.

The nation’s biggest private employer is testing out a comprehensive new framework for how its stores operate, including changing some roles and responsibilities and emphasizing teamwork, accountability and skill improvement. The new model, dubbed “Great Workplace,” is already in place in about 75 locations, primarily its smaller Neighborhood Market grocery stores, and will expand to certain departments in more than 50 of its massive supercenter locations next month.

The new model will include pay raises for some hourly and salaried supervisors, who will shoulder more leadership responsibility in return. Staffers lower on the totem pole will receive more training, additional support from managers and better recognition for jobs well done.

“Associates like smaller teams, and they like having a connection with a leader. They want something they can own and to know if they are winning or losing every day. And today that does not always happen,” Drew Holler, U.S. senior vice president of associate experience, said in an interview.

The goal is to improve Walmart’s reputation as an employer, which has been under attack for decades from labor activists and has spawned a spate of lawsuits accusing the retailer of everything from gender and age discrimination to not paying employees during breaks in their shifts.

New Structure

Store managers remain at the top of the new structure, but under them will be about a half-dozen “Business Leads,” who will manage the store’s finances and all hiring efforts, among other duties. Their salaries will start about 10 percent higher than what assistant store managers currently make, according to a Walmart spokesman. Reporting to them will be “Team Leads,” whose pay starts at $18 an hour. They’ll supervise groups of eight to 10 front-line associates.

Supercenter locations will be comprised of about 15 to 20 teams, each with one “Academy Trainer,” who will work to “upskill” employees and make sure they “understand the correct way to perform their jobs,” according to internal documents viewed by Bloomberg.

The kit also includes “Attitude Cards” that managers will carry around with them during shifts, so they can remind staffers of the four behaviors promoted by the program: Be bold, be an owner, be open and be kind.

Gold Stars

Employees who perform well will earn “stars” -- multiple blue stars can be exchanged for a silver star, and silvers can lead to a gold. Those who get gold stars will receive a reward set by store leadership, which could include lunch with the store manager, according to the company documents. Some employees have bristled at the star system, calling it childish, and Walmart could make changes to that and other aspects of the program going forward, according to the Walmart spokesman.

Great Workplace also details how team meetings should be run, starting with the Walmart company cheer and moving on to review sales data and discuss assigned work. The documents also suggest to “bring a bag of candy and toss a piece to those who bring up ideas discussed in meetings.”

Walmart is addressing its workforce issues at the same time it’s adding robots to perform repetitive tasks like cleaning floors and sorting deliveries in the backroom. The company has said the automation will not replace human workers; rather, it will free them up to interact more with customers.

“We will compete with technology but win with people,” Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said in internal documents viewed by Bloomberg laying out the new structure.

Indiana's Walmart Stores East to Pay $10K to Resolve Charge of    Discrimination

Walmart Stores East LP in Indianapolis, Indiana, will pay $10,000 and furnish other relief to resolve a disability charge filed by the Indianapolis District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency announced.

The EEOC's investigation found reasonable cause to believe that the Walmart Stores East LP store #2787 in Indianapolis refused to provide a reasonable accommodation to an employee with a disability. As a result, the employee was forced to resign, the EEOC said.

Such alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which protects people against employment discrimination based on disability. The ADA also requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with a disability if they need the accommodation to perform the essential functions of the job.

The conciliation agreement settling the discrimination charge provides $10,000 in monetary relief to the employee.

The agreement prohibits Walmart East Stores LP from violating the ADA in the future, specifically the obligation to reasonably accommodate any employee who qualifies for an accommodation under the ADA.

Walmart East Stores LP also acknowledged its obligation not to engage in unlawful retaliation. Walmart East Stores LP will reissue its computer-based learning module pertaining to the company's policies against disability discrimination and accommodations in employment, to those salaried members in management in Store #2787. The conciliation agreement also provides for the EEOC to monitor the company's compliance with reporting provisions.

Beyond Off-the-Shelf Solutions: Retail is undergoing rapid transformation for a variety of reasons. The 2019 IRI Growth Summit gave attendees new perspectives on some familiar issues.

IT'S NOT broccoli, it's business. No matter what they're buying, consumers these days are buying it everywhere and in every retail channel. What can a personal care product marketer learn from a fashion expert or a frozen food buyer? Plenty.

Which is why the IRI Growth Summit keeps expanding; the seventh edition of the summit, which took place in Denver amid a springtime blizzard, attracted 1,600 attendees from across the consumer packaged goods universe.

IRI is the Chicago-based company that was one of the first research firms to harness big data to help CPG, retail and OTC companies grow their businesses. For more than two decades, IRI has provided Happi's readers with multi-channel sales data for several key household and personal product segments. The company notes that it works with more than 95% of CPG, retail, and health and beauty companies in the Fortune 100.

In his opening presentation, IRI president and CEO Andrew Appel explained how artificial intelligence and human intelligence will power future growth, noting that his company has invested nearly $1 billion in its technology during the past several years.

"Companies in our ecosystem are looking at data and technology as the next enabler of competitive advantage, in creating speed, consumer intimacy and process efficiency," said Appel. "Every major company in our industry is increasing their investment in the space, knowing that mastering the technology of tomorrow is one of the most important levers of competitive advantage."

As part of his keynote address, Appel discussed automated insights, augmented decision making and decision automation as transformative processes with significant implications for business operations. While acknowledging that increased automation may bring uncertainty, Appel stressed that automating simple tasks is essential for keeping up with the accelerating evolution of consumer preferences and ultimately bringing about applied change.

Appel advised IRI clients to "embrace and add new capabilities. Take risks and do it at speed. Be comfortable and confident enough in the augmented and automated decisions that you no longer have to be the guarders of the information."

The company maintains that delivering differentiated growth for clients requires deep, highly integrated partnering with a variety of best-of-breed companies. Therefore, IRI works closely with a broad range of industry leaders across multiple industries and sectors to create innovative joint solutions, services and access to capabilities to help its clients more effectively collaborate and compete in their various markets and exceed their growth objectives. The IRI Partner Ecosystem includes such leading companies as 84.51[degrees], Adobe, The Boston Consulting Group, Clavis Insights, comScore, Data Plus Math, Edison, Experian, GfK, Gigwalk, Google, Ipsos, Jumpshot, Mastercard Advisors, MaxPoint, MFour, Omnicom, One Click Retail, Oracle, Pinterest, Research Now/SSI, Simulmedia, SPINS, Univision and Viant.

Most recently, IRI announced a new relationship with Casey's General Stores, a chain of convenience stores in the midwest and southern United States. Casey's will provide IRI access to its point-of-sale from more than 2,100 Casey's stores to support its account-level insights for the c-store channel. IRI also announced it is expanding relationships with Speedway, Circle K, EG Group--including Turkey Hill, Loaf 'N Jug, Kwik Shop, Tom Thumb and Quik Stop--and other leading convenience store chains across North America to provide brands with the most granular and well-informed insights available for the c-store channel.

Winning Companies & Brands

Finding the right partner is more critical than ever, especially after several years of retail challenges. The good news is that CPG companies enjoyed slightly accelerated growth in 2018. And while, sustainable volume growth was lacking, the fastest-growing companies increased volume by offering a good product assortment to meet consumer wants and needs, according to IRI executives.

"Thanks to the power of big data analytics, we are able to take a critical look at companies of varying sizes to glean important insights about industry trends and understand the drivers of the top performers,"said Krishnakumar (KK) Davey, president of IRI Strategic Analytics, during the Summit. "The CPG companies winning in today's marketplace are doing so because they drive volume, maintain a targeted approach to mergers and acquisitions, and act on the consumer trends influencing purchase behavior."

In a study of the CPG category conducted by IRI and Boston Consulting Group, Constellation Brands, the $6 billion adult beverage maker in New York, topped the CPG growth-leader list of large companies (more than $5.5 billion in IRI measured sales), followed by Monster Energy, Procter & Gamble, Keurig, Dr Pepper and General Mills. The leaders among midsized ($1 billion to $5.5 billion) companies were Juul Labs, L'Oreal, Blue Diamond Growers, Post Consumer Brands and Starbucks. Topping the growth-leader list of small (less than $1 billion) companies were Vital Pharmaceuticals, Harry's, Bodyarmor SuperDrink, Lamb Weston and Rana Meal Solutions.

Companies were ranked on a combination of three metrics: dollar sales growth, volume sales growth and market share gains.

Some of the other findings include: large and mid-sized players outside of the top 10 are in decline; in addition to driving growth, acquisitions and partnerships facilitate entry into new categories, acquire new consumers and build new capabilities; and accelerate in acquisition and investment in small growth leaders during the past few years.

"Small companies that lead year-on-year end up getting acquired," observed Davey.

He pointed out that regardless of the category or retail channel, they all share several trends, including a move toward plant-based ingredients, premium and convenient, and indulgent versus better for you.

Eliminate Barriers to Buying

Where and how consumers are purchasing all of these products is undergoing a dramatic transformation, observed IRI's Fernando Salido, adding that since 2015, 57 major US retailers have filed for bankruptcy. In contrast, Aldi and Dollar General are posting sales gains of 7% a year, and Salido predicted that Aldi could become the No. 3 grocer, in terms of store count, by 2023.

He noted that not too many years ago, Walmart's strategy was "build it and they will come." As a result, Walmart built in rural areas and was able to grab a commanding share of household dollars from a wide area. But that "gravitational pull" has weakened as e-commerce grabs a bigger and bigger share of shoppers' dollars--and e-commerce eliminates distance from the shopping equation.

"E-commerce is taking over high-income shopper dollars," he explained. "We see a big shift to ecommerce in the Northeast and California."

According to Salido, 28% of beauty products are now purchased online; that's significant, but still below other categories such as vitamins (48%) and pet food (43%). But Amazon wants more. In September, the e-commerce giant launched Go, a cashier-less store, in Seattle and as many as 3,000 more Go stores may be on the way. But not even Amazon gets everything it wants. Last month, after much public outcry, the company said it will begin accepting cash in the specialized store. Critics said that by refusing to accept cash, Amazon was discriminating against low-income consumers.

How can traditional retailers compete in today's environment? By reducing distance between them and their customers, increasing store experience, eliminating friction at the point-of-sale and leveraging momentum to increase sales. Salido noted that Walmart has increased its market cap by 40% in the past three years by maximizing something it calls "Every Day High Convenience." Or, as Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said, "Customers are time-crunched, so we want their shopping experience with us to be fast and easy--truly seamless--in all the ways they want to shop: in stores, on their mobile device, or through pickup and delivery."

Besides eliminating barriers to buying, retailers must improve the "wow" factor when it comes making purchases. According to Salido, these include friendly in-store service, problem-solving ability, execution excellence and great brand experience.

Wegmans tops the bill in nearly all categories and is ranked No. 1 in customer experience, he added.

What Happens Tomorrow?

They're just beginning to reach their prime buying years, but Mike Walsh is already sick and tired of Millennials.

He asked, "What is the point of connecting data if you can't weaponize to create experience? By 2030, Millennials will be as old and as miserable as the rest of us!"

The CEO of Tomorrow, an innovation consultancy, noted that in 10 years or so, the way companies market and sell products and the way people buy them will be dramatically different. In fact, Walsh predicted that, in the future, retailers will send consumers packages before they order them!

"Interfaces will become more natural and more human," he said. "Facial recognition will become a way of life."

As the author of "The Algorithmic Leader: How to be smart when machines are smarter than you," Walsh predicted that all experiences will be algorithmic and that augmented reality will transform our ideas of identity.

"In 2030, devices will influence who we are," he insisted. "The Apple watch of the future won't tell you the time; it will tell you how much time you have to live!"

If you're time here is short, you may as well make the most of it. Pam Forbus, SVP, Walt Disney Studios, gave attendees some suggested readings to get what they want out of life. Her list of books includes: Crossing the Threshold: life begins at the end of your comfort zone by Neale Donald Walsch; Survival of the Savvy: high integrity political tactics for career and company success by Marty Seldman and Rick Brandon; and Grit by Angela Duckworth, which offers lessons on resiliency.

Friction-Free Futures

Will Post, industry manager for consumer packaged goods at Facebook, asked the provocative question, "Why do people buy the things they buy?"

It's a valid question; after all, people are connecting fundamentally differently than they have in the past, but businesses are the same. The bridge, he said, is technology.

"People spend three hours a day on mobile and check their mobile devices 80 times a day," said Post. "But why?"

Mobile, he explained, is the new store-front, even the new end-cap, and Facebook is building shopping experiences that improves people's lives, he insisted.

"Mobile makes it (buying) personalized and frictionless; products start searching for the right people!"

Post suggested three ways CPG companies can win in this new reality: direct to consumer, which is why Nespresso teamed up with Facebook; collaborating with retail, Facebook is working with Walmart, CVS and others; and, of course, e-commerce.

"We are moving toward a zero-friction future for retailers and their CPG partners," Post concluded.

CBS reaches settlement with campaigners demanding stronger board oversight

Directors at companies including Amazon and Walmart are being called on to step up their fight against sexual harassment as the #MeToo movement forces its way on to the agenda of US annual meetings for the first time.

Campaigners have argued that investors should vote in favour of strengthened board oversight to prevent further scandals because such controversies can damage corporate reputations and wipe billions of dollars off market capitalisations.

“You want to know that the board knows what’s going on, and is actively working on managing the risk,” said Sarah Lewis, an official with the AFL-CIO union federation. Hospitality, technology and logistics are among the sectors being targeted.

In a sign that the scrutiny is leading some companies to review their stance, activists have dropped a demand for a shareholder ballot on the issue at CBS after they reached a settlement with the media group, according to people familiar with the matter.

CBS, whose longtime chief executive Les Moonves left last year in light of sexual misconduct allegations, had faced calls to review the terms of incentive pay packages and consider wider policy changes. CBS declined to comment on the terms of its agreement with the Service Employees International Union.

The property sector is also in the spotlight. Institutional Shareholder Services, the influential shareholder advisory group, is backing a call for the property company CBRE to prepare a report on the use of mandatory arbitration in dealing with sexual harassment claims. 

Under mandatory arbitration, employees forfeit their right to sue the company and agree to have a dispute heard by a neutral party, often in private. Some companies, including Google, Microsoft and Uber, have dropped this practice after accusations that it was being used to bury allegations of sexual harassment.

However, in response to the calls for strengthened board oversight, several companies said they were already doing enough to deal with the problem, pointing to initiatives including anti-harassment training for staff and anonymous hotlines.

CBRE said it took the “prevention of sexual harassment in the workplace very seriously”. The preparation of a report on the use of mandatory arbitration, demanded by AFL-CIO, would be “unnecessary given the company’s established and ongoing practices” and its preparation would be “costly, inefficient and distracting”.

Amazon, which campaigners are calling on to consider the release of statistics including the number of disciplinary actions, said it “does not tolerate sexual harassment”.

The ecommerce company had taken steps including “reporting mechanisms” for employees to report allegations and a ban on retaliation for those who made complaints in good faith.

United for Respect, which represents retail workers, has called on Walmart to compile a report reviewing how it dealt with sexual harassment allegations. But Walmart said this was “unnecessary”.

“Our policy strictly prohibits discrimination or harassment,” the retailer said, adding that such a review would “distract from the execution of other important and ongoing strategic initiatives”.

Companies typically face shareholder votes on a wide range of matters and such motions often receive low levels of support. Even so, the backing of ISS for the review of mandatory arbitration by CBRE suggests some institutional investors could back the demands.

“Additional information regarding the risk associated with a mandatory arbitration policy may bring information to light that could result in improved recruitment, development, and retention,” ISS said. 

AFL-CIO said: “It is no longer socially acceptable to deny victims of sexual harassment their day in court.”

Demands for stronger board oversight will also be on the ballot at several property companies with interests in hotels.

Courtney Alexander, deputy director at campaign group Unite Here, said: “Investors are aware that the issue of sexual harassment is a real one in the hospitality industry. In the wake of the public #MeToo movement, it’s certainly getting more attention.”

Asda offers ‘free alcohol’ in wrong Welsh translation

Asda has apologised after a branch in Cwmbran, Monmouthshire, translated a sign incorrectly from English to Welsh. Shoppers saw the notice “free alcohol” when it should have been “alcohol free”.

A spokesperson for the supermarket said it was now changing the sign, which read “am ddim” as opposed to “di-alcohol”. In a statement, it said: “Mae’n ddrwg gennym [we are sorry].

Helium balloons ‘cause £1m of train delays’

Helium balloons are causing hundreds of train delays at a cost of £1m in taxpayer money every year, Network Rail has said. The party favourites are becoming tangled in high voltage wires above rail lines after being released into the air, the company claims.

It says there were some 619 so-called ‘balloon incidents’ on the network last year alone. Many of those resulted in significant hold-ups because removal from cables often requires the line’s electricity to be switched off. Network Rail made the warning as part of an awareness campaign around the issue.

Four in five teachers duffer workplace bullying

Teachers are turning to alcohol and prescribed drugs to cope with workplace bullying, a survey suggests. Four in five teachers have been victims of bullying in the past year, the NASUWT teaching union says.

A survey of nearly 2,000 teachers revealed that 45 per cent have visited their GP to cope with bullying, while others have turned to prescribed drugs (18 per cent) and alcohol (17 per cent). Some teachers are considering self-harming and have even quit the profession because of bullying.

A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Our teacher recruitment and retention strategy, launched in January, focuses on the wellbeing of school and college staff and in particular the importance of developing supportive cultures.”

Universities spent £87m on ‘gagging orders’ to keep bullying and sexual misconduct claims quiet

UK universities have spent £87m on payoffs with ”gagging orders” to keep allegations of bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct quiet, it has been reported. The huge sum is said to have been spent on around 4,000 settlements over the past two years.

Universities UK, the sector’s representative organisation, said non-disclosure agreements were used for “many purposes” but should not be used to prevent victims from speaking out, according to the BBC. The body said it is developing comprehensive new guidance on sexual misconduct that will be published in the autumn.

EXCHANGE --- Big Brother at the Mall --- Is facial recognition coming to a store near you? The privacy debate in Congress moves beyond e-commerce to bricks-and-mortar stores

By John D. McKinnon

Washington -- The battle to protect consumer data is moving from cyberspace to shopping malls, as Congress scrutinizes how advanced technology increasingly follows shoppers around bricks-and-mortar stores.

Retailers including cosmetics chain Sephora use electronic Bluetooth beacons to detect customers' smartphones as they enter the store, allowing them to ping shoppers with promotions as they browse -- and see where they linger.

In the fitting rooms at Rebecca Minkoff apparel stores, shoppers can tap on interactive mirrors to see how a top might match with other garments, with each choice being fed into the shopper's online profile.

Meanwhile, facial-recognition technology is being marketed to retailers as a way to flag people who have previously shoplifted or sought refunds for stolen merchandise. For now, many retailers are apprehensive but use of the technology is starting to make its way into real-world commerce, including retail. Walmart Stores Inc., Lowe's Cos. and Target Stores Inc. say they have tested facial-recognition systems but currently don't use the technology.

Retailers say new technologies are largely aimed at improving the shopping experience, helping old-fashioned stores stay competitive with online merchants. In-store tracking helps alert customers to sale items, for example, and facial recognition can let shoppers breeze through checkout stands by speeding up the payment process.

Stores say they've been forced to adopt high-tech data collection tools like beacons to remain viable as consumers do more shopping online. But in-store beacons haven't been as useful as hoped, often sending promo messages only to customers who have the store app open, for example. So there's interest among retailers in moving to the next stages of technology, particularly facial recognition.

"Technology is rapidly erasing any differences between how precisely people can be tracked online and in a physical space," said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union. "So we're going to need all the same protections offline that we do online."

The data-privacy debate in Congress has largely taken aim at online social media and e-commerce companies, but key committee leaders in both the House and Senate are vowing to include bricks-and-mortar retailers in any legislation.

"It is clear to me that we need a strong, national privacy law that provides baseline data protections [and] applies equally to business entities -- both online and offline," said Senate Commerce Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, at a recent hearing.

Facial-recognition systems are being marketed as a means to monitor customers or employees, said Joseph Jerome, policy counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology. That raises the likelihood that unregulated data-sharing cooperatives would emerge among retailers, he said -- as well as accuracy concerns and the risk of unfair blacklisting.

"It has serious impacts for how you go about your life," he said.

The inclusion of bricks-and-mortar stores in privacy legislation is supported by online companies like Amazon.com Inc., where executives are concerned that internet businesses could be singled out for restrictions. But it's drawing concern from traditional retailers who worry that their cutting-edge technologies could be banned or disrupted if they are included under the privacy law.

Retailers also fret that uniform privacy rules could limit their ability to use longstanding data-collection techniques. A landmark privacy law passed by California last year prohibits discrimination against shoppers who decline to share certain personal information. That could restrict businesses' use of loyalty programs and leave stores vulnerable to litigation, retail groups say.

"The nondiscrimination clause in California would invite lawyers to sue every store that has a loyalty program," said Paul Martino, vice president of the National Retail Federation. Many retailers worry that imposing privacy rules designed for the online world could disrupt the customer experience -- for example, by requiring cumbersome opt-in.

Retailers are also apprehensive about giving customers so much control over their data that they could simply move it from one business to a rival, Brian Dodge, chief operating officer of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said in recent testimony to the Senate Commerce Committee.

Some retailers privately fear that Amazon, with its expanding market clout, could buy up their hard-won data on the cheap. Amazon and e-commerce companies, meanwhile, argue that the rules should be uniform for all retailers. One concern for online retailers is that many bricks-and-mortar retailers have been feeding the busy wholesale trade in consumer data for years, but haven't come in for the kind of scrutiny that Facebook and other internet giants have endured in recent months.

"Americans should have consistent experiences and expectations across state lines and industries -- regardless of whether they're interacting with a company online or offline," Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, said at the Senate hearing. Internet Association members include Amazon, Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit, Facebook Inc., eBay Inc., Uber Technologies Inc., Airbnb Inc. and others.

Common in-store tools such as cameras, Bluetooth monitors and other types of beacons scattered around stores can be used for relatively straightforward purposes -- for example to generate traffic counts without identifying individual customers. But some used in conjunction with a smartphone app or other technologies can identify customers or their accounts individually and even offer to charge them for items they select from shelves, as Amazon has begun to do at its Amazon Go stores.

Courtney Marin, a 22-year-old New Yorker coming out of Sephora's Times Square store in Manhattan, said she doesn't mind that the retailer sends her in-store promos. "Sometimes they have brands there that are having an event," she said.

Another customer, Rosy Jerez, 23, said that when she goes to a store she already knows what she wants. "For today I needed a concealer, so in and out, I went for a concealer."

The ACLU's Mr. Stanley said that with tomorrow's technology likely to include in-store sensors to detect shoppers' mood, eye movements and heart rate, the need for privacy protections is getting more urgent. "As the sensors get better and artificial intelligence gets smarter, the limits of information that can be collected are the limits of the human imagination," he said.

An emerging industry of companies sell facial-recognition systems, including Ayonix Face Technologies Inc. of Richmond, Va. The company declined to identify clients, but said it had systems in place at several stores.

"We are monitoring return visits of people that are trying to scam the store," said Mike Broggie, Ayonix's chief executive officer.

When the ACLU surveyed 20 of the country's largest retailers last year to determine if they use facial recognition, all except two declined to answer. Several said the information was proprietary or raised competitive concerns. Of the two that responded, a grocery chain said it wasn't using it and Lowe's told the ACLU it might use the technology to prevent shoplifting. Lowe's told The Wall Street Journal it has since decided against using the technology after testing it in three stores.

A spokeswoman for Target said the company tested facial recognition last summer as a way to deter theft and fraud in a small number of stores but isn't using it now. "We'll continue to test and learn from new technologies that have the potential to keep our guests and team members safe," she said.

A Walmart spokesman said there was "a brief facial recognition test a few years ago in a handful of stores for loss prevention, but that was ended." He said the company was still "actively exploring how the technology could be used to benefit customers."

One reason for retailers' reluctance is the potential for blowback from customers.

For privacy advocates, another set of concerns revolves around how the data is used. Would one incident of teenage shoplifting lead to someone being barred from stores for life? Studies also show that facial recognition is less accurate for people of color; what happens in cases of mistaken identity?

A federal Commerce Department effort to craft voluntary standards for the use of facial recognition fell apart in 2015 as big companies and trade associations resisted agreement on any scenarios where facial recognition could only be used with consent.

A flurry of privacy bills -- including one by Sens. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) and Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii) that would bar commercial users of facial recognition from tracking consumers without their consent -- have been introduced in anticipation that the Senate will eventually consider a broad privacy bill.

"We need guardrails to ensure that, as this technology continues to develop, it is implemented responsibly," Mr. Blunt said.

Ms. Jerez, the Sephora shopper, was skeptical about the prospect of facial recognition in stores. "If a store is using my face, what else are they going to use it for? You don't know."

Zaitoon Sharif was shopping in the Toryglen branch with her kids when the man began shouting at her

A GLASGOW mum was left shocked after being told to “f**k off” and “go back to your own country” while shopping with her kids.

Shocking footage has surfaced online of Zaitoon Sharif being racially abused by a fellow Asda customer in front of her young frightened daughters.

In the clip, the unknown man can be heard shouting at Zaitoon – who puts him in his place by responding “I was born here mate”.

She adds: “This man has threatened me, I’m here doing the shopping with my kids, I’m not breaking any laws.”

It is understood officers are now probing the incident.

Taking to social media, Zaiton revealed how it was her “first official experience of a racist/hate crime”.

She also told how her daughters were left “absolutely shaken and terrified” by the incident.

Zaitoon said: “So I have just had my first official experience of a racist/,hate crime towards me.

“I was in Toryglen Asda in Glasgow with two of my girls under the age of 12 and also my niece.

“A Scottish caucasian man decided to spout poison a lot of the usual stuff ‘your kind, go back to your own country, you lot are all the same etc etc’ he was being verbally abusive and even suggested I should wait until I get outside and he will show me.

“From where I was standing all I saw was a pathetic attempt of him trying to pronounce the word discrimination along with a few other pathetic attempts to even communicate.

“Anyway I wasn’t going to stand for it and I asked the staff to call the police.

She added: “The kids were absolutely shaken and terrified by the whole thing.

“If I take anything away from this incident, it’s always stand up for yourself ( in a dignified manner ) even though I’m sure my French came out a few times and also if you see someone being harassed just stand beside them , you dont have to say anything or do anything just show the person they are not alone.

“Hate crime, racism, Islamophobia has reared its ugly head again.”

An Asda spokesperson said: “We expect our customers and colleagues to be treated with respect and will not tolerate offensive behaviour in our stores.

“Where necessary to address an issue, colleagues will call the police, which they did on this occasion.”

A spokeswoman for Police Scotland told STV : “An investigation is underway after a woman was subjected to racial comments at a supermarket in Toryglen last night.

“Officers attended the scene and enquiries are ongoing.”

Big Brother at the Mall; The privacy debate moves beyond e-commerce as magic mirrors and beacons log shoppers' data in bricks-and-mortar stores

WASHINGTON—The battle to protect consumer data is moving from cyberspace to shopping malls, as Congress scrutinizes how advanced technology increasingly follows shoppers around bricks-and-mortar stores.

Retailers including cosmetics chain Sephora use electronic Bluetooth beacons to detect customers' smartphones as they enter the store, allowing them to ping shoppers with promotions as they browse —and see where they linger.

In the fitting rooms at Rebecca Minkoff apparel stores, shoppers can tap on interactive mirrors to see how a top might match with other garments, with each choice being fed into the shopper's online profile.

Meanwhile, facial-recognition technology is being marketed to retailers as a way to flag people who have previously shoplifted or sought refunds for stolen merchandise. For now, many retailers are apprehensive but use of the technology is starting to make its way into real-world commerce, including retail. Walmart Stores Inc., Lowe's Cos. and Target Stores Inc. say they have tested facial-recognition systems but currently don't use the technology.

Retailers say new technologies are largely aimed at improving the shopping experience, helping old-fashioned stores stay competitive with online merchants. In-store tracking helps alert customers to sale items, for example, and facial recognition can let shoppers breeze through checkout stands by speeding up the payment process.

Stores say they've been forced to adopt high-tech data collection tools like beacons to remain viable as consumers do more shopping online. But in-store beacons haven't been as impactful as hoped, often sending promo messages only to customers who have the store app open, for example. So while there is trepidation, there's also strong interest among retailers in moving to the next stages of technology, particularly facial recognition.

Privacy advocates, however, say the risks of abuse from in-store tracking of customers are as high as online.

Risk of Abuse

"Technology is rapidly erasing any differences between how precisely people can be tracked online and in a physical space," said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union. "So we're going to need all the same protections offline that we do online."

The data-privacy debate in Congress has largely taken aim at online social media and e-commerce companies, but key committee leaders in both the House and Senate are vowing to include bricks-and-mortar retailers in any legislation.

Share Your Thoughts

Should consent be required for facial recognition in stores? What about sensors on shopping carts that detect heart rate or monitors that detect eye movements? Is a sign in the store sufficient? Join the conversation below.

"It is clear to me that we need a strong, national privacy law that provides baseline data protections [and] applies equally to business entities—both online and offline," said Senate Commerce Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, at a recent hearing.

Facial-recognition systems are being marketed as a means to monitor customers or employees, said Joseph Jerome, policy counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology. That raises the likelihood that unregulated data-sharing cooperatives would emerge among retailers, he said -- as well as accuracy concerns and the risk of unfair blacklisting.

"It has serious impacts for how you go about your life," he said.

The inclusion of bricks-and-mortar stores in privacy legislation is supported by online companies like Amazon.com Inc., where executives are concerned that internet businesses could be singled out for restrictions. But it's drawing concern from traditional retailers who worry that their cutting-edge technologies could be banned or disrupted if they are included under the privacy law.

Retailers also fret that uniform privacy rules could limit their ability to use longstanding data-collection techniques such as customer-loyalty programs. A landmark privacy law passed by California last year prohibits discrimination against shoppers who decline to share certain personal information. That could restrict businesses' use of loyalty programs and leave stores vulnerable to litigation, retail groups say.

Shopper Surveillance

Online retailers have a wealth of data, on customers, including on shopping history, payment and email. Traditional retailers are finding their own high-tech ways to fight back.

* Magic Mirrors—Some retailers including women's-apparel company Rebecca Minkoff gather data through interactive mirrors and other devices in fitting rooms or on counters.

* Smartphone Tracking—Some retailers use beacons to detect customers' smartphone apps as they enter stores, allowing them to ping shoppers with promotions as they browse the aisles. Retailers also can get location information from other apps. Shoppers can also be tracked if they sign up for in-store Wi-Fi.

* Facial Recognition—A few big chains have tested facial-recognition software, mainly to identify people previously caught shoplifting. But many retailers remain wary of blowback from shoppers, even as the broader use of facial recognition grows.

"The nondiscrimination clause in California would invite lawyers to sue every store that has a loyalty program," said Paul Martino, vice president of the National Retail Federation. Many retailers worry that imposing privacy rules designed for the online world could disrupt the customer experience—for example, by requiring cumbersome opt-in.

Retailers are also apprehensive about giving customers so much control over their data that they could simply move it from one business to a rival, Brian Dodge, chief operating officer of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said in recent testimony to the Senate Commerce Committee.

Some retailers privately fear that Amazon, with its expanding market clout, could buy up their hard-won data on the cheap. Amazon and e-commerce companies, meanwhile, argue that the rules should be uniform for all retailers. One concern for online retailers is that many bricks-and-mortar retailers have been feeding the busy wholesale trade in consumer data for years, but haven't come in for the kind of scrutiny that Facebook and other internet giants have endured in recent months.

"Americans should have consistent experiences and expectations across state lines and industries—regardless of whether they're interacting with a company online or offline," Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, said at the Senate hearing. Internet Association members include Amazon, Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit, Facebook Inc., eBay Inc., Uber Technologies Inc., Airbnb Inc. and others.

Common in-store tools such as cameras, Bluetooth monitors and other types of beacons scattered around stores can be used for relatively straightforward purposes—for example to generate traffic counts without identifying individual customers. But some used in conjunction with a smartphone app or other technologies can identify customers or their accounts individually and even offer to charge them for items they select from shelves, as Amazon has begun to do at its Amazon Go stores.

Courtney Marin, a 22-year-old New Yorker coming out of Sephora's Times Square store in Manhattan, said she doesn't mind that the retailer sends her in-store promos. "Sometimes they have brands there that are having an event," she said. Another customer, Rosy Jerez, 23, said that when she goes to a store she already knows what she wants. "For today I needed a concealer, so in and out, I went for a concealer. But I know people that are so into makeup that that would be something they'll use a lot."

The ACLU's Mr. Stanley said that with tomorrow's technology likely to include in-store sensors to detect shoppers' mood, eye movements and heart rate, the need for privacy protections is getting more urgent. "As the sensors get better and artificial intelligence gets smarter, the limits of information that can be collected are the limits of the human imagination," he said.

A Sensitive Issue

An emerging industry of companies sell facial-recognition systems, including Ayonix Face Technologies Inc. of Richmond, Va. The company declined to identify clients, but said it had systems in place at several stores.

"We are monitoring return visits of people that are trying to scam the store," said Mike Broggie, Ayonix's chief executive officer.

The issue is a sensitive one for companies. When the ACLU surveyed 20 of the country's largest retailers last year to determine if they use facial recognition, all except two declined to answer. Several said the information was proprietary or raised competitive concerns. Of the two that responded, a grocery chain said it wasn't using it and Lowe's told the ACLU it might use the technology to prevent shoplifting. Lowe's told The Wall Street Journal it has since decided against using the technology after testing it in three stores.

A spokeswoman for Target said the company tested facial recognition last summer as a way to deter theft and fraud in a small number of stores but isn't using it now. "We'll continue to test and learn from new technologies that have the potential to keep our guests and team members safe," she said.

A Walmart spokesman said there was "a brief facial recognition test a few years ago in a handful of stores for loss prevention, but that was ended." He said the company was still "actively exploring how the technology could be used to benefit customers."

One reason for retailers' reluctance is the potential for blowback from customers. Another is the concern that facial-recognition software might make mistakes in identifying people.

For privacy advocates, another set of concerns revolves around how the data is used. Would one incident of teenage shoplifting lead to someone being barred from stores for life? Could merchants share data? Studies also show that facial recognition is less accurate for people of color; what happens in cases of mistaken identity?

A federal Commerce Department effort to craft voluntary standards for the use of facial recognition fell apart in 2015 as big companies and trade associations resisted agreement on any scenarios where facial recognition could only be used with consent from people subjected to it.

A flurry of privacy bills—including one by Sens. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) and Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii) that would bar commercial users of facial recognition from tracking consumers without their consent—have been introduced in anticipation that the Senate will eventually consider a broad privacy bill.

"We need guardrails to ensure that, as this technology continues to develop, it is implemented responsibly," Mr. Blunt said.

Ms. Jerez, the Sephora shopper, was skeptical about the prospect of facial recognition being used in retail stores. "I have facial recognition for my iPhone but it makes more sense because it's something personally for me, you know? But if a store is using my face, what else are they going to use it for? You don't know."

Uber Reveals Epic Wins for Investors | With IPO Comes End of an Era

Good day. Finally, it has arrived. A long-awaited peek behind the Uber curtain reveals long-held secrets about its various businesses, its top shareholders and its growth rate.

The most valuable startup to go public since Facebook in 2012, Uber showed in its IPO filing on Thursday that the spectacular growth it has enjoyed in its core ride-hailing business has leveled off lately.

Revenue from ride-hailing—excluding items such as driver referrals and some incentives—was $2.31 billion in the fourth quarter, little changed over the prior six months.

And of course there's a rundown of the key investors' stakes and how their returns are shaping up. A packed news development so let's start breaking it down.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Payday is nigh: When seed venture firm First Round Capital first invested in a startup called UberCab back in 2010, many investors were skeptical.

That year, First Round led a $1.5 million seed funding round into the company at a roughly $5 million valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter. The firm was the first institutional investor to back what became Uber Technologies Inc.

Now First Round—along with other venture investors—is on the verge of a major haul. Even after selling a chunk of its interest, First Round still owns the lion's share of its Uber shares, according to this person. WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian and Tomio Geron have the scoop.

Uber's offering also is poised to generate epic returns for elite investors like SoftBank Vision Fund, Benchmark and Menlo Ventures. WSJ Pro's Katie Roof has the story.

Rescue the robots: Robotics companies are jumping into food delivery, testing out different models in limited areas.

While people fear that robots will someday take over everyone's jobs—and maybe even the world—for now, the prototypes can run into trouble just getting a burger and fries to a dorm.

The imperfect autonomous technology often leads robots into a comedy of errors as they try to navigate public spaces—compelling softhearted humans to come to their rescue. WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian has the A-Hed.

Beyond ‘mouse models': The clues to curing some of humanity's most devastating diseases may lie with animals. That's the working theory behind a handful of startups taking the concept of animal testing to new heights.

These entrepreneurs are amassing a trove of data that could unlock new insights into how we treat the same diseases in humans.

Some are studying the way hibernating mammals have survived unscathed life-changing conditions including Alzheimer's or heart attacks, while others are applying precision medicine therapies to dogs with cancer.

"These are shared diseases," said One Health Co-founder and Chief Executive Christina Lopes. WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has the story.

Geron's Take: Uber Gets Ready to Close Its Startup Chapter

By Tomio Geron

Uber Technologies Inc.'s massive initial public offering won't only be the year's largest for a venture-backed startup. It also will mark something of an end of an era.

Founded as a ride-hailing trailblazer in 2009, Uber helped usher in profound change for the startup world and the venture industry—but not always intentionally.

Along the way, the company for many would become the public face of a range of startup trends spanning gender discrimination, founder-investor control tensions and, most famously, the gig economy.

Taking a company public in itself doesn't do away with any of these matters, but Uber's move to Wall Street required it to reckon with its past and overcome it.

More in Geron's Take

Exits

PagerDuty Inc. shares opened at $36.75 in their first day of trading, 53% above the $24 pricing of the company's initial public offering. Later the stock closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $38.25. Andreessen Horowitz was the company's largest pre-IPO shareholder, owning 18.4%, followed by Accel at 12.3% and Bessemer Venture Partners with 12.2%.

SolarWinds Corp. said it is acquiring IT services provider Samanage Ltd. for $350 million in cash, bolstering its offerings. Samanage, based in Cary, N.C., previously raised $74 million from investors including Marker and Salesforce Ventures. SolarWinds, based in Austin, Texas makes management software for businesses said it expects to begin adding Samanage's IT products to its portfolio in the second quarter, which is also when the deal is expected to close.

Vivid Seats, a secondary ticket provider backed by private-equity firm GTCR, acquired Fanxchange for up to $60 million. Toronto-based Fanxchange is an online marketplace that enables users to purchase or redeem loyalty points for tickets to events. The company is backed by investors including Azure Capital Partners, Plaza Ventures and Gibraltar & Co.

Walmart is adding to its expanding advertising business with an agreement to acquire technology and assets of ad startup Polymorph Labs for an undisclosed amount. The San Francisco-based company is backed by investors including Onset Ventures, InterWest Partners and HillTop Venture Partners.

Heartbeat, a marketing technology platform that connects brands with millennial and Generation Z consumers, acquired jewelry startup Iconery for an undisclosed amount. Los Angeles-based Heartbeat is backed by investors including Sinai Ventures, Backstage Capital, Techstars and Firebrand Ventures. Iconery counted Crosscut Ventures, Human Ventures, Amplify and Canyon Creek Ventures as backers.

VC Funds

North Base Media raised $15 million toward its NBM Investment Fund II LP fund, which is targeting $75 million, according to a regulatory filing. The Chevy Chase, Md.-based firm invests in media, content and information technologies. Its portfolio includes LifePosts Inc., Cielo24 Inc. and the News Lens.

New Money

Asklepios BioPharmaceutical Inc. said it has closed a $235 million financing that will enable it to develop a series of gene therapies. TPG Capital and Vida Ventures are investing $225 million and Asklepios founders and board members are contributing $10 million, according to the company, better known as AskBio. The capital will help it expand clinical trials and improve its manufacturing capabilities. Research Triangle Park, N.C.-based AskBio said it recently moved a therapeutic for Pompe disease, which causes glycogen to accumulate in cells, into clinical trials. It is also developing treatments for heart failure and other disorders.

Read the full decision in Mr S Zerehannes v Asda Stores Ltd: 2600155/2018 - Reasons.

Published 6 February 2019

Last updated 1 April 2019 + show all updates

* 27 March 2019 Case No. 2600155/2018 1 EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNALS EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNALS EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNALS EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNALS Claimant: Mr S Zerehannes Respondent: Asda Stores Limited PRELIMINARY HEARING Heard at: Nottingham (in public) On: 28 January 2019 Before: Employment Judge Camp (sitting alone) Appearances For the claimant: Dr R Ibakakombo, lay representative For the respondent: Mr A MacMillan, counsel REASONS 1. These are the written version of the Reasons given orally at the hearing for: refusing the claimant’s amendment application; making a deposit order. Written reasons were requested by the claimant’s representative at the hearing. The two parts of these Reasons were given at different points during the hearing and not at the same time, one straight after the other. Amendment 2. I am dealing now with the Claimant’s amendment application to add a complaint under section 80H of the Employment Rights Act 1996. 3. That application appears originally to have been raised as a possibility not by the claimant but by Employment Judge Britton at the previous preliminary hearing which took place on 25 September 2018. In other words, it was the Judge’s idea. That doesn’t make it a bad or a good thing. Its significance is that the earliest date at which one could say this application surfaced was 25 September 2018. Employment Judge Britton effectively suggested to the claimant that he should decide whether or not he wanted to make a claim under section 80H and that if he decided he did, he needed to put one forward. The claimant eventually did so in the Scott schedule that Judge Britton ordered him to provide, submitted around a month after the hearing. 4. The date on the Scott schedule (which may not be the date when it was actually submitted), which I take to be the date of the amendment application itself, is 26 Case No. 2600155/2018 2 October 2018. The application is set out at internal pages 125 to 126 of that Scott schedule document and I refer to what the claimant says there. 5. Before me, Dr Ibakakombo, who represented the claimant, submits that the application is really a relabelling of facts that are already there, that there would be no hardship to the respondent’s side by allowing the amendment because the evidence that would have to be given would be exactly the same, and that the proposed section 80H claim relates to harm being done to the claimant that is continuing. 6. In deciding whether or not to allow an amendment, I obviously have in mind the well-known Selkent guidance. What I am actually applying, though, is the overriding objective, but I don’t see any conflict between the Selkent guidance and the overriding objective. I need to take all factors into account - all relevant circumstances. A particularly important, but not necessarily determinative, matter is time limits. 7. There is a relatively recent decision on whether, if the tribunal allows an amendment, time ‘relates back’, as it were, so that if I were to allow an amendment that would effectively mean that the section 80H claim which I have permitted the claimant to add by way of amendment would be deemed to have been presented at the time the original claim was presented. That decision of the EAT - Galilee v The Commissioner of Police of The Metropolis [2017] UKEAT 0207_16_2211 - was to the effect that there is no ‘relation back’. I happen to think that decision is wrong and there is a question mark as to whether or not it is binding on me because it may be per incuriam and contrary to other authority. But I make my decision on a neutral basis so far as concerns whether it is right and/or binding on me. In other words, my decision would be the same either way. What I am looking at is time limits, amongst other things, and time limits are in any event important, even if they are not determinative. 8. The claim is, then, about a flexible working request of a kind and the allegation in the claim form and the allegations which have been added by way of amendment permitted by Employment Judge Britton all relate to that flexible working request. Essentially, the claimant’s case is that he applied for flexible working in order to be able to accommodate his wife’s disability; that the application was not granted and was dealt with badly; and it not being granted and being dealt with badly, including the appeal against it and so on, are acts of, variously, direct race discrimination, direct disability discrimination, and, potentially, victimisation as well, at least in relation to the later acts. 9. Is the proposed section 80H claim just a relabelling? I don’t think it is, because I think the claimant misunderstands what the relevant sections of the Employment Rights Act 1996 ("ERA") are all about. 10. There isn’t actually any appellate authority on this that I am aware of, but the relevant provisions of the ERA were changed in accordance with the Children and Families Act of 2014 and there were some flexible working regulations introduced as well. There were various reasons for those changes and new provisions. One of them was to try and make things a little bit simpler. What we have been left with is section 80G(1)(a), which states: "An employer to whom an application under section 80F is made shall deal with the application in a Case No. 2600155/2018 3 reasonable manner". A debate which I have had many times during hearings is what dealing "with an application in a reasonable manner" means and whether it goes to the substance or is merely about procedural matters. My present view on that is that it does not mean "shall deal with the application reasonably". I emphasise the word, "manner". In other words, it is geared, if you like, to the way in which the application is dealt with rather than the merits of dealing with the application. So it is not, "is the employer’s decision reasonable?", because if that’s what it meant, that is what it would say. 11. This application to amend is to make a claim under sections 80G(1)(a) / 80H based on the request for flexible working not having been dealt with reasonably, rather than it not be dealt with in a reasonable manner. If it is were altered so as to as to be a true application under those sections and deal with procedural matters, the problem would then be that the complaint being added would be quite different from what is already in the claim. It would not, in other words, just be a relabelling. 12. Because it is not just a relabelling exercise, time limits become much more important than they would otherwise be. I start with when time limits would run from. In accordance with section 80G(1)(b), the decision period applicable to an employee’s request under section 80F is the period of 3 months beginning with the date on which the application is made, or such longer period as may be agreed by the employer and the employee. That is, in turn, referred to in section 80H, the relevant dates being the date the employer notifies the employee of the employer’s decision or, if the decision period applicable to the application under section 80G(1)(b) comes to an end without the employer notifying the employee of the employer’s decision, the end of the decision period. 13. There are, then, two possible limitation periods there. In this case, on the facts, I think the true limitation period would have to be 3 months from when the original application was made. If we assume that the application is a valid application under section 80F, something I will come back to, the application was made on 29 April 2017. So the time limit would run from 28 July 2017. It isn’t suggested by the claimant or on his behalf that there was any agreement to extend the period. Indeed, one of the claimant’s complaints is that the application was not dealt with properly and in time. To the extent it was dealt with, it was dealt with late but there was no agreement with the claimant or his representative to this. 14. However let us assume for present purposes that time actually runs from the decision date. Again there is a question mark over that, because I can’t actually see a formal decision being made anywhere. There is no bit of paper. But it seems to me the latest date it can have been made is 16 September 2017, which is the date of a meeting that was held with the claimant and his representative. This was the day before the claimant appealed against the decision, referring in his appeal to a decision of the fourteenth. So let’s say, being as generous to the claimant as I possibly can, that time runs from 16 September. 15. The claimant went through early conciliation from 12 December 2017 to 9 January 2018, so the latest date within which the claimant could have made this flexible working claim without an extension of time, if it had been a freestanding Case No. 2600155/2018 4 claim, would have been 8 February 2018. In fact, as I have already mentioned the application is first mentioned at all on 25 September 2018 and isn’t actually made until the back end of October 2018. So if we are looking at time limits it is very significantly out of time. It is also a "not reasonably practicable" time limit. Given that the claimant mentioned in his claim form section 80F, albeit just as background, there is no discernible reason why it was not or might not have been reasonably practicable for him to present this claim at the same time as he presented his original claim form. Therefore it would be very significantly out of time were it being presented as a freestanding claim. 16. If there is ‘relation back’ and that recent decision of the EAT is wrong then I would effectively be destroying a valid defence that the respondent would have to limitation were I to permit the amendment. 17. If there is no relation back, what would be the point in allowing the claimant to amend in order to bring a claim which is doomed to failure on limitation grounds? 18. Either way, it seems to me that limitation, in the particular circumstances of this case is by itself determinative of this application. I cannot see any good reason why I should allow a claim which is manifestly out of time to proceed by way of amendment and in those circumstances I decline the amendment application. 19. I should add another thing - the thing I said I would go back to. It seems to me that there was actually no request under section 80F in the first place. The thing which is relied on by the claimant as the application under ERA section 80F is a letter and an "informal" request form, which appear at pages 217 to 219 of the bundle. I refer to them. 20. First, section 80F requires an application to state that it is such an application. 20.1 I think it perhaps needn’t necessarily say, "This is an application for flexible working under section 80F", but it must say something which clearly indicates that it is a formal flexible working application and not merely an informal one, because one can make any number of informal applications for flexible working in some way, shape or form, but if it is a statutory application under the ERA you can only make one per year. There are various other significant consequences of something being a statutory application, and various hurdles which have to be gone through, and so on and so forth. This is not a merely technical detail. It’s important because it affects the rights and duties of the claimant and the respondent whether or not it is actually a formal application. 20.2 These documents relied on by the claimant don’t tick that box. They don’t state that it is an application and they don’t say anything that indicates that it is such an application without actually referring specifically to the section. 21. The second requirement is they must specify the change applied for and the date on which it is proposed the change should be affected. The claimant’s request just about states the change applied for, although not very clearly, but doesn’t state what date it’s to be effective from. 22. The third ‘box’ that has to be ‘ticked’ in accordance with section 80F(2) is that the application must explain what effect, if any, the employee thinks making the Case No. 2600155/2018 5 change applied for would have on his employer and how in his opinion any such effect might be dealt with. Again, that isn’t there at all. 23. It seems to me that this amendment application, if I were to allow it, would result in a claim doomed to failure because there was no application under ERA section 80F and it would be out of time. What would be the point in my exercising my discretion to allow the claimant to bring a claim which he is never going to win? 24. For those reasons, in all the circumstances, I refuse the claimant’s application to amend. Deposit order 25. In terms of the relevant law, I take into account, in particular, paragraph 24, part of Lord Steyn’s speech, of the House of Lords’ decision in Anynanwu v Southbank Student Union [2001] ICR 391 and paragraphs 29 to 32 of the Court of Appeal’s decision in North Glamorgan NHS Trust v Ezcias [2007] EWCA Civ 330. When assessing whether a claim has "no reasonable prospects of success", the test to be applied is whether there is no significant chance of the trial tribunal, properly directing itself in law, deciding the claim in the claimant’s favour. Subject to one proviso, in applying this test I must assume that the facts are as alleged by the claimant. The one proviso or qualification is that I do not make that assumption in relation to any allegation of fact made by the claimant so implausible that I think there is no significant chance of any tribunal, properly directing itself, accepting the allegation as true. 26. The law as to the meaning of "little reasonable prospects of success" in rule 39, which relates to deposit orders, is not as clear as perhaps it should be, but my understanding of the test I have to apply is that it is the same as that set out above in relation to "no reasonable prospects of success" but with the word "little" replacing the word "no" in the phrase "no significant chance". 27. In terms of relevant discrimination law I note first the wording of the relevant sections of the Equality Act 2010 ("EQA"), in particular sections 13 and 23. In terms of case law, our starting point is paragraph 17, part of the speech of Lord Nicholls, of the House of Lords’s decision in Nagarajan v London Regional Transport [1999] ICR 877. I also note the contents of paragraphs 9, 10 and 25 of the judgment of Sedley LJ in Anya v University of Oxford [2007] ICR 1451. 28. So far as concerns the burden of proof, a succinct summary of how [the predecessor to] EqA section 136 operates is provided by Elias J [as he then was] in Islington Borough Council v Ladele [2009] ICR 387 EAT at paragraph 40(3), which I adopt. One is looking, first, for "facts from which the court could decide, in the absence of any other explanation" that unlawful discrimination has taken place. Although the threshold to cross before the burden of proof is reversed is a relatively low one - "facts from which the court could decide" - unexplained or inadequately explained unreasonable conduct and/or a Case No. 2600155/2018 6 difference in treatment and a difference in status1 and/or incompetence are not, by themselves, such "facts"; unlawful discrimination is not to be inferred just from such things - see: Quereshi v London Borough of Newham [1991] IRLR 264; Glasgow City Council v Zafar [1998] ICR 120 HL; Igen v Wong [2005] IRLR 258; Madarassy v Nomura International Plc [2007] EWCA Civ 33; Chief Constable of Kent Police v Bowler [2017] UKEAT 0214_16_2203. Further, section 136 involves the tribunal looking for facts from which it could be decided not simply that discrimination is a possibility but that it has in fact occurred. See South Wales Police Authority v Johnson [2014] EWCA Civ 73 at paragraph 23. 29. The claim I am looking at is an ‘associative’ disability discrimination claim. There is, of course, no such thing as "associative discrimination" in the EQA. In order for there to be associative discrimination of any kind what one has to do is to bring the claim as a direct discrimination claim. (Arguably, it could also be a harassment claim but we aren’t concerned with that here). 30. Direct discrimination is less favourable treatment because of a protected characteristic, in this case disability. A direct discrimination claim can be an associative discrimination claim by making the allegation one that there has been less favourable treatment because of a disability, rather than because of the claimant’s disability. In this case, the disability in question is the claimant’s wife’s disability. The claimant’s wife’s disability is asthma and the respondent has accepted that she is and was at all relevant times a disabled person because of asthma. 31. The claim relates to a (probably informal) flexible working application that the claimant made some time ago, in April 2017. Essentially, the claim is that it was discrimination to refuse that application and it was also discrimination to fail to deal with it and to reject the appeal against the decision refusing it. There is a long list of claims, but they all boil down to, "the respondent should not have refused this application for flexible working and it should have dealt with the applications and any appeal against it differently from the way in which the respondent did". 32. The claimant’s case is that the reason why his flexible working application was denied, whereas others weren’t or wouldn’t have been, was because of his wife’s disability. He was making his application in the context of needing to look after his children at weekends (his application was to work fewer weekends than he was obliged to do under his then existing rota) because his wife could not do so, or had difficulties doing so, by herself because of her disability. He has to be alleging that if he had made the application for some other reason, for example his wife worked at weekends, or his wife had some different disability, or his wife had caring responsibilities at weekends, then it was significantly more likely to have been allowed; and that it was, particularly, his wife’s disability that was the reason for the respondent’s treatment of him. 33. It is often said, and rightly so, that everyone is prejudiced; everyone has prejudices. For example, there is a cliché, also no doubt true, that everyone is 1 i.e. the claimant can point to someone in a similar situation who was treated more favourably and who is different in terms of the particular protected characteristic that is relevant, e.g. is a different age, race, sex etc. Case No. 2600155/2018 7 racist and sexist (and so on) to a certain extent. I am not, though, sure that that really could be said about a prejudice against people who have asthma or people who are married to people who have asthma. That would be rather an idiosyncratic prejudice to have, but that is the prejudice which the claimant is alleging against the respondent - in fact, against a number of people working for the respondent and not just one individual. 34. To explain the evidence from which the claimant will be seeking to infer that, in fact, unusually, in this case a number of people at the respondent were prejudiced against the claimant because of his wife’s asthma, the claimant has provided some information in a form of Scott schedule. This is the only information we have about this. The Scott schedule has a column for "Reason why claimant says it is race/disability discrimination". (There is also a race discrimination claim which we are not concerned with at the moment). What is put in there in every instance is "No explanation was given as to whether the following people" - and then he lists a number of people’s request to care for someone (a disabled wife/husband or children) - "… the needs of the flexible work for the people above was higher than the claimant’s needs to take care of his disabled wife". That’s it. 35. What is stated is slightly peculiar in and of itself. Another of the columns in the Scott schedule is supposed to be any comparator relied on. Unlike the claim for race discrimination - which is relevant to this extent - the claimant is not relying on those individuals who are named in the column for "Reason why claimant says it is race/disability discrimination" as comparators. 36. The claimant relies purely on hypothetical comparators in relation to disability discrimination. The hypothetical comparator is described in the following way in the Scott schedule: "Claimant comparison his case with colleagues in Asda with a disabled or long term sickness member of the family such as wife or husband who has been in fact granted flexible working". That hypothetical comparator shows that the claimant’s case is specifically focused on asthma, i.e. it isn’t even the claimant’s case, as set out in the Scott schedule, that the respondent is generally prejudiced against people wanting flexible working in order to accommodate caring responsibilities directly or indirectly resulting from someone’s disability. Instead, the alleged prejudice is specifically against someone who is married to someone who has asthma. 37. For reasons which I simply cannot imagine a number of individuals at this particular warehouse of Asda’s - it is alleged - dislike people who have asthma and/or people who are married to people who have asthma, as opposed to other conditions. This is not a prejudice I have ever encountered or heard of. All prejudices are irrational, but that would be a particularly peculiarly irrational one and so it would really require something quite special to generate a prima facie case for the burden of proof to reverse pursuant to section 136 of the Equality Act 2010 at any hearing. 38. What is there that might reverse the burden of proof? The answer to that is: nothing. If I take the claimant’s case to be as set out in the Scott schedule, although when explaining why it is disability discrimination, he refers to other people’s flexible working applications being granted and no good reason being Case No. 2600155/2018 8 given for why they were granted (and his wasn’t), if he is not relying on those people as comparators - and he isn’t in relation to disability discrimination - then those other people’s cases are irrelevant. 39. If the claimant was saying they were comparators, one possibly could argue that the lack of an explanation (and so on) was something to be relied on in relation to EQA section 136. It probably wouldn’t trigger that section, but he is not even saying that. He is saying, "These aren’t valid comparators; I am relying on a hypothetical comparator". Therefore, what happened to people who aren’t his comparators is neither here nor there. 40. Because I have to put the claimant’s case at its reasonable highest, I shall assume that actually he is saying they are comparators. Are they valid comparators? I have my doubts. 41. The claimant has limited English and doesn’t otherwise speak the same language as his representative and is going to need an interpreter at the final hearing. (I checked with his representative whether we could go ahead with this hearing without an interpreter and he said that we could and so I have done so). I am concerned that language difficulties between the claimant and his representative mean that there may have been miscommunication and misunderstanding there. Perhaps more to the point, it seems to me inherently highly unlikely that all of these people who are named - and there are maybe 9 or 10 names given - can possibly be valid comparators in accordance with EQA section 23. To be valid comparators they would have to be people who made comparable flexible working applications - not just any flexible working application, but a flexible working application to reduce weekend working like the claimant’s - and that they were not making that application because of the need to look after children because of their partner’s asthma-related difficulties. 42. Again, let’s be generous to the claimant. Let’s assume that notwithstanding what is put in the Scott schedule, in fact this is a claim made on the basis that people’s flexible working application would have been granted had it been for something that wasn’t a long term health condition like asthma. It is very unclear to me, to say the least, that these people are valid comparators even if I stretch the claimant’s pleaded case to this extent - beyond breaking point. 43. More importantly still, even if there are one or two valid comparators - and it seems improbable - we would still not be looking at something from which an inference of discrimination could be drawn, because all there would be was a difference of treatment and a difference of protective characteristic. In other words, the tribunal at trial would be drawing a comparison between people whose partners didn’t have a long term health condition and the claimant whose partner did. That they were treated differently would not be enough, in accordance with the case law I have referred to. 44. There is a logical reason why it’s not enough that sometimes people don’t appreciate. I tried to illustrate it in submissions by discussing an age discrimination claim. Everyone has protected characteristics and at least one protected characteristic of everyone is different, namely age. If it were enough for an inference of discrimination to be drawn for there to be a difference in treatment and a difference in protected characteristic then every time anyone Case No. 2600155/2018 9 was treated differently from anyone else in the work place they would have a prima facie age discrimination claim. They don’t and they don’t on authority and the reason is that there has to be more; there has to be more as a matter of logic and a matter of law than a difference of treatment and a protected status in order for the burden of proof to reverse. 45. I checked with the claimant’s representative during submissions whether there was anything else and he did not suggest that there was. The claimant is purely relying on a difference of treatment and a difference in status. 46. If that is all there is then the claim is bound to fail, it seems to me. 47. In this case we have two factors pointing against the claimant’s chances of succeeding in this disability discrimination claim. One of them would also apply to the victimisation claim and, to an extent, to the race discrimination claim, but they are not before me. I do record, though, that I have concerns about the viability of those other claims as well. 48. The two factors that apply in this case are: 48.1 first, the inherent unlikelihood of there being this idiosyncratic prejudice against asthmatics and/or those married to them. The claimant will have to try and persuade the tribunal at trial that something which is inherently very unlikely is actually what happened. The claimant starts at least one step back from the starting line, as it were; 48.2 you then add to that the question, "what material will the claimant have from which the tribunal could draw an inference that discrimination had taken place?" and the answer, "nothing" (on the claimant’s pleaded case) or, at best, potentially (if the pleadings are inaccurate), "a difference of treatment and a difference of status", which is not enough. 49. What you are left with is a disability discrimination claim which I think has negligible chances of success. I can see the respondent thinking that that ought to mean that I strike out the claimant’s case. But I am not going to do that. I have umm-ed and ah-ed about this, but I am obliged to err on the side of caution. (There is plenty of legal authority saying I am bound to do that). I am by the narrowest of margins not satisfied by the respondent that this particular set of complaints - this claim of associative disability discrimination - has no reasonable prospects of success. 50. But the respondent has definitely established to my satisfaction that it has at best little reasonable prospect of success. Accordingly, subject to any submissions as to the amount of the deposit order and any information the claimant wishes to provide about his financial means, I am proposing to make one or more deposit orders in relation to this claim. [Further submissions were then made and some information about the claimant’s means was provided] 51. Further to my decision that in principle I thought a deposit order should be made, I have now had submissions on how much and how many deposit orders should be made. Case No. 2600155/2018 10 52. The original suggestion made by respondent’s counsel was that there should be one deposit order for each of the claimant’s complaints of disability discrimination. I don’t accept that submission and I think ultimately respondent’s counsel has back-tracked from that a little bit. 53. In another case it might be appropriate to make separate deposit orders, but the advantage in principle of making separate deposit orders for separate complaints is that the claimant could win on one and lose on another, and potentially the deposit orders would still ‘bite’. In this case, the reason why I am ordering one and not more deposit orders is that I don’t think the claimant will be able to establish a prima facie case of discrimination in relation to any of his complaints. I do not think there is any evidence or will be any evidence from which an inference of discrimination can be drawn. If the claimant overcomes that hurdle, whether he wins or loses the claim, no deposit orders will bite. Equally, if he doesn’t get over that hurdle, then all deposit orders (if I made more than one) would bite. I cannot envisage a scenario in which the claimant gets over the deposit order hurdle at the final hearing in relation to one disability discrimination complaint but not in relation to another. Either he’s going to establish a prima facie case of discrimination or he isn’t. Making one deposit order therefore seems to me to be appropriate. 54. Turning to the amount of the deposit order, respondent’s counsel has understandably asked for the maximum amount. The suggested figure that has been put forward by Dr Ibakakombo on the claimant’s behalf is £500. 55. It appears the claimant currently has savings of £4,000. He also has some equity in a property. He bought the property for £157,000 last year and the mortgage was £131,000 so there is £26,000 at least in that property, albeit it might be quite difficult to get at that equity in practice. 56. The claimant has effectively taken a break from working for Asda for a bit. That may be subject to negotiation, but in any event he is working in a self-employed capacity, and has been since the end of November, earning £500-£600 a week. He has outgoings. I accept that things are tight, although he has hasn’t suggested to me that he has no money to spare at the end of each week once his essentials have been paid. He has not been in receipt of any benefits, presumably because there has been no basis for him receiving benefits. He has also received some payments from the respondent for, I think, accrued holiday pay and backdated sick pay, although those are probably relatively small amounts. 57. I understand the claimant has plans for his savings. People generally do have plans for their savings. He may have to change those plans if I order a deposit order of more than £500. When I asked Dr Ibakakombo why it should only be £500 and not £1,000, he said the claimant can "easily" pay that amount [£500]. If the claimant can easily pay the amount then it’s not enough for a deposit order. The point of a deposit order is two-fold. The first purpose of a deposit order is to make the claimant think twice about whether or not he or she wishes to pursue their claim, in circumstances where an Employment Judge who has no axe to grind (in this case me) has decided that that claim is very unlikely to succeed. It is not in anyone’s own interests to carry on with a claim if they are going to lose Case No. 2600155/2018 11 at the end of the day and a deposit order really needs to be enough to make them think about that. 58. The second purpose is, of course, effectively to change the position on costs from what it usually is and put the claimant at risk on costs and make him think twice about carrying on that way. 59. If the claimant is just thinking, "I can easily afford to pay this amount of money, so that’s the amount of money I want to pay", that is not the right approach and that would not serve the purpose of a deposit order. 60. I see no good reason, given the information I have been provided with about the claimant’s financial means, why it shouldn’t be the maximum amount of £1,000. He has £4,000 in savings and has a choice. Either he uses £1,000 out of those £4,000 savings to pay a deposit and carry on with a claim which I think he is almost bound to lose, or he decides to let that claim go and keep his £1,000 to do with whatever he wants to. That’s the choice which I am presenting him with. I am making a deposit order in the sum of £1,000. Employment Judge Camp 25 March 2019 Sent to the parties on: .………………………….
