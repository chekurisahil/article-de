Wage & Hour Suits A Growing Uninsured Risk, Advisen Finds

Insurers have been slow to respond with coverage for wage-and-hour lawsuits that have been an escalating threat to companies of all sizes over the past decade, Advisen Ltd. said in a new study.

The 21-page report, “The Threat of Wage-and-Hour Lawsuits,” examines the drivers of these suits and explores recent developments in wage-and-hour litigation. Additionally, it includes a survey of insurers that provide possible coverage.

Typically, wage-and-hour suits involve allegations that employers have failed to pay wages for time worked, or failed to pay at rates required by law.

According to Advisen, the Department of Labor (DOL) estimates that 80 percent of employers are not in compliance with applicable wage-and-hour laws.

Now outranking discrimination lawsuits, measured by both number of filings and size of settlements, employment practices lawsuits have become an unforeseen calamity for companies across all industry sectors, the firm said.

Alterations made to the Federal Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by the DOL in 2004 were originally intended to clarify definitions to make it easier for companies to comply. Instead, it brought focus to the issue and sparked awareness among the plaintiff's bar, according to the report.

Advisen noted that the DOL and certain state labor departments have stepped up enforcement efforts in recent years, and the DOL has ramped up its Wage-and-Hour Division under the Obama administration.

These elevated regulatory efforts not only result in more fines, but precipitate class action civil lawsuits by employees allowed under the FLSA and equivalent state labor laws, Advisen said.

“Publicity surrounding changes made to the Federal Labor Standards Act in 2004 has been a catalyst for class action lawsuits,” John Molka III, author of the report, said in a statement.

“On top of that, enforcement efforts by the U.S. Department of Labor have further stimulated class actions. American businesses are exposed to very large losses from these suits, but the insurance industry has been slow to respond with coverage for this risk,” said Mr. Molka.

Although every sector is susceptible, the retail sector has been targeted in many of the largest suits, the report found. Wal-Mart alone has been named in more than 80 wage-and-hour class action civil suits and has agreed to settlements in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

In 2008, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. agreed to pay between $352 million and $640 million to settle 63 wage-and-hour lawsuits filed in 42 different states. The lawsuits accused the company of cheating hourly workers by forcing them to work through breaks and not paying them.

A class action lawsuit filed on behalf of Wal-Mart workers in Minnesota in 2008 was settled for $54.3 million, including back pay, for requiring hourly employees to work off the clock as well as payments for other violations of the state’s wage and hour laws.

Advisen noted it tracks more than 6,000 significant employment cases and events. These records total more than $12 billion in loss and they include hostile work environment, whistleblower/retaliation, and discrimination and harassment.

A 16-year-old Atlantic County boy arrested after the racially tinged announcement at the Turnersville Wal-Mart this month did the same thing Dec. 28, police reported yesterday.

The youth, whose name has not been released because he is a juvenile, is now charged with two counts each of harassment and bias intimidation, Washington Township police said.

He is accused of announcing over a Wal-Mart telephone March 14 that "all the black people" should leave the store, on Route 42. Police arrested him after examining surveillance cameras and social Web sites such as Facebook and YouTube.

Wal-Mart representatives have apologized and secured their public address system to prevent future problems.

After the incident, Loretta Winters, president of the Gloucester County NAACP, received reports that a similar announcement had been made before, but said Wal-Mart had considered it "just a prank" and had not reported it to police. She said "the persistence of the NAACP" had led to further investigation.

Police said Wal-Mart managers this week turned over a surveillance recording from December that showed the youth making a similar announcement about 10:30 p.m.

Walmart Canada upholds unique family status needs of employee

TORONTO, March 25 /CNW/ -- TORONTO, March 25 /CNW/ - Walmart Canada recently recognized the unique family status of one of its associates who is the sole caregiver for a severely disabled family member. Walmart's work scheduling requirements had conflicted with the associates' exceptional situation.

Both the associate and Walmart Canada agreed to an order from the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario that allows CD to work specific times on weekdays when she is not required to attend to the unique needs of her family member. The arrangement provides appropriate scheduling flexibility to enable CD to meet Walmart's work scheduling requirements in a manner that is fair to both CD and her fellow associates at the store.

"We are very pleased to have reached an agreement with CD," said Andrew Pelletier, Walmart Canada's Vice-President of Corporate Affairs. "Our corporate culture is one of respect. We believe that when an associate is faced with unique family obligations like those of CD, who is the sole caregiver for a severely disabled family member, it is important to provide the right work environment."

Under Ontario's Human Rights Code, employers have a legal obligation to accommodate the special needs of employees to meet pressing family obligations where those employees can demonstrate a necessary obligation to care for family members.

"Our client is very happy with the outcome and relieved to be able to continue both her work and her demanding care obligations," said Beth Walden, CD's lawyer from the Human Rights Legal Support Centre.

CD has requested anonymity from the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario out of consideration for her family member.

Walmart Canada operates a growing chain of 317 stores, serving more than one million Canadians each day. With more than 80,000 associates, the company is Canada's third-largest employer. In 2009, Walmart Canada's corporate culture was ranked among the 10 most admired corporate cultures in Canada by Waterstone Human Capital Inc.

The Human Rights Legal Support Centre provides legal assistance to people in communities across Ontario who have experienced discrimination contrary to the Ontario Human Rights Code, and may want to file an Application to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario.

Wal-Marts nationwide secure intercom systems

A racist remark that was broadcast at a Wal-Mart in Turnersville has prompted the national chain to fix intercom systems that have been plagued by bogus store announcements for years.

"It's something we're implementing nationwide in all our stores," said Ashley Hardie, a spokeswoman for the discount chain.

The majority of 2,800 Wal-Mart supercenters "updated their systems" last weekend, she said, declining to divulge details of what that entailed.

Washington Township police Sunday announced they had arrested a 16-year-old Atlantic County boy on harassment and bias intimidation charges for using the intercom at the Turnersville store March 14 to ask "all the black people" to leave. The youth, who is white, has been released to the custody of his parents.

If convicted, he could face a brief stay at a juvenile facility and/or counseling, authorities said.

Police also have not ruled out arresting his companion, who is also a minor. Neither was an employee.

Witnesses said that when the announcement was made, a hush came over the crowded store on Route 42, and at least five uneasy minutes elapsed before management used the loudspeaker to tell people to disregard the message.

Wal-Mart officials have since apologized.

The announcement was "insensitive to the black community and what blacks have gone through historically, with 'whites only' segregation," said Loretta Winters, president of the Gloucester County NAACP. "People were hurt and were wondering 'Why do we have to leave? What's going on?' "

Police later checked surveillance tapes inside the store and gathered cyber intelligence from Facebook and YouTube Web sites before making the arrest. The youth's name was not disclosed because he is a minor.

Police also are investigating complaints that a similar announcement was made three or four months ago at the same store and that a March 17 phone call placed to the store used a racial slur. Washington Township Deputy Chief John Dalesandro said a warrant was approved for phone records to see who made that call.

YouTube has a long list of homemade videos, mostly created by teenage boys, showing intercom pranks played at Wal-Marts and a few other department stores across the country during the last few years. Some of them, with more than two million page views, feature rants, profanity, burping, and announcements about free giveaways and outrageous sales.

Some inform viewers how they can just pick up a Wal-Mart phone and dial two numbers to access the loudspeaker.

Hardie said the Turnersville store, which was the first Wal-Mart to open in New Jersey, in 1991, now has a secure PA system.

Kathy Grannis, spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation, said that this problem has been around a couple of years.

"Unfortunately, it's not new," she said. "It's something retailers have dealt with for a while."

Daniel Butler, a vice president with the federation, said he believed the use of the intercom to make a racist remark was rare.

"I've never heard of it before," he said. "People can lose their jobs over this, and what someone may think is humorous can have serious consequences."

A WHITE teen caused outrage by ordering all African American shoppers to get out of a supermarket.

The 16-year-old boy, who can't be named, had grabbed one of the courtesy phones in the huge Wal-Mart store in Washington Township, New Jersey.

He then calmly announced: "Attention, Wal-Mart customers, all black people, leave the store now."

The lad was charged with harassment and bias intimidation.

He was later released into his parents' custody until his case can be heard at a juvenile court.

Walmart prank 'disturbing': YouTube, Facebook clues help nab teen

The 16-year-old boy who allegedly asked "all black people" to leave a South Jersey Walmart last week is the latest in a long line of pranksters who've baffled customers with odd announcements in the retailer's stores across the country.

But while others have hijacked the public-address system to slash prices, play music or page Jesus and Michael Vick, authorities say that the announcement at the Washington Township, Gloucester County, Walmart was no prank.

"He didn't just go on the loudspeaker and say basketballs are half-priced for the next half-hour," Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean Dalton said. "He said something a little more disturbing."

On Saturday, Dalton and the Washington Township Police Department announced the arrest of the 16-year-old Atlantic County resident who picked up a phone in the store's home-and-garden section on March 14 and said "Attention, Walmart customers: All black people, leave the store now."

A law-enforcement source said that the teen was a white student at Buena Regional High School, in Buena Vista Township, Atlantic County. He was arrested and charged with harassment and bias intimidation before being released to his parents.

Washington Township police could not be reached for comment yesterday, but Dalton said that YouTube and the social-networking site Facebook helped nab the teenager.

"There had been some chatter about this on social-networking sites," he said.

Walmart officials said that the incident at the South Jersey store was "appalling" and that they've taken steps to fix the public-address system at the store, but PA breaches are nothing new for the corporation.

There's an entire Web site dedicated to Walmart pranks, and YouTube has hundreds of videos of teens and young adults accessing the intercoms at stores. There's even a Facebook page dedicated to the code pranksters need to push to get on the PA system.

One YouTube poster claims that a video of a male impersonating a professional wrestler on the PA system was taken at the Washington Township store.

Loretta Winters, president of the Gloucester County NAACP, said that there have been race-related announcements at the Washington Township store in the past and that police are looking into them.

"The manager said it was almost the same thing verbatim," she said. "The first time it happened, they took it as a prank. It doesn't make any sense that these systems would be open to the public."

At the Walmart on Columbus Boulevard, in South Philadelphia, shoppers said that they had never heard odd or racist comments over the PA system, but there were mixed opinions over the severity of the South Jersey case.

Shirley Outlaw, a teacher in Center City, said the case was being blown out of proportion.

"I think he took advantage of an opportunity and did something dumb," Outlaw said. "It was spur of the moment, obviously not well thought out, and I don't think it was derogatory."

Dolores Coker, 30, said the announcement was more proof that kids "make no sense."

"I don't know what goes through their heads," she said.

Another woman, who asked not the be identified, said that she would have been very offended if she heard the announcement.

"It's obvious racism exists in this country," she said. "It's sad, but not everyone would understand."

A 16-year-old customer at a Walmart store in Washington Township, N.J., has been identified as the person who took over the public-address system and ordered black people to leave the store, police said Saturday, the Associated Press reported.

Police said the boy, whose name is not being released because he is a juvenile, went on the intercom at Walmart's store last week Sunday and announced: "Attention, Walmart customers: All black people, leave the store now."

The teen was arrested Friday on charges of harassment and bias intimidation. Authorities said he was released to the custody of his parents; they did not know whether he had a lawyer.

"This was an extremely disturbing event on many levels," Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean Dalton said at a news conference. "Any statements like these that can cause harm or grave concern must be addressed as quickly we possibly can."

Dalton said the case would be handled in juvenile court in neighboring Atlantic County, where the boy lives.

"We're pleased this matter is resolved," Walmart spokesman David Tovar said in a statement issued after the news conference. "We have updated our intercom system at this store to prevent this from happening again. We again apologize to all of our customers and associates who had to listen to something so offensive."

WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. - A 16-year-old boy who police said made an announcement at Walmart ordering all black people in the southern New Jersey store to leave was charged with harassment and bias intimidation, authorities said Saturday.

The boy, whose name is not being released because he is a juvenile, grabbed one of the courtesy phones at Walmart's Washington Township store Sunday evening and calmly announced: "Attention, Walmart customers: All black people, leave the store now," police said.

The teen was arrested Friday and released to the custody of his parents; police did not know whether he had a lawyer.

"This was an extremely disturbing event on many levels," Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean Dalton said at a news conference. "Any statements like these that can cause harm or grave concern must be addressed as quickly as we possibly can."

Dalton said the case would be handled in juvenile court in neighboring Atlantic County, where the boy lives. He would not say whether the boy has a criminal record, citing the teen's age, and would not reveal the boy's race.

The 16-year-old has been charged with harassment and bias intimidation.

Authorities would not say whether the announcement was planned or made impulsively. Police said they were also investigating a teenage boy who accompanied the suspect to the store, but the other boy has not been charged.

Officials for Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said the announcement was "unacceptable," and Dalton praised the company for its strong cooperation in the investigation.

"We're pleased this matter is resolved," Walmart spokesman David Tovar said in a statement issued after the news conference. "We have updated our intercom system at this store to prevent this from happening again. We again apologize to all of our customers and associates who had to listen to something so offensive."

Although a manager quickly went on the intercom system and apologized for the remark, many customers expressed their anger to store management. Some community members said Saturday that they've heard reports of similar incidents happening at the store in recent months that were not reported to police.

"We are concerned about that, and we're looking into these incidents. We want to work with the community to make sure these types of incidents don't happen," said Loretta Winters, president of the Gloucester County chapter of the NAACP.

Winters said she hopes the boy gets counselling. "I'm assuming this person didn't realize how hurtful his comments were."

WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. -- Authorities in southern New Jersey have arrested a 16-year-old boy for activating a public-address system at a Wal-Mart store and ordering "all black people" to leave.

The youth was charged by Gloucester County authorities with bias and intimidation and harassment in connection with the episode last week. If convicted, he could face up to a year in a juvenile detention centre. His name was not released.

Police told a news conference Saturday the youth picked up a public-address telephone in the Wal-Mart in Washington Township, one of two dozen accessible to the store's customers, and said, "All black people, leave the store now."

A store manager quickly apologized over the public-address system, witnesses said, and the police and the store opened separate investigations that included a review of images captured by the store's security cameras.

With the help of anonymous tipsters, he added, investigators were led to the suspect, who was arrested Friday.

"We got lucky," Muniz said.

WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ A 16-year-old boy who police said made an announcement at Walmart ordering all black people in a southern New Jersey store to leave was charged with harassment and bias intimidation, authorities said Saturday.

The boy, whose name is not being released because he is a juvenile, grabbed one of the courtesy phones at Walmart's Washington Township store Sunday evening and calmly announced: ``Attention, Walmart customers: All black people, leave the store now,'' police said.

The teen was arrested Friday and released to the custody of his parents; police did not know whether he had a lawyer.

``This was an extremely disturbing event on many levels,'' Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean Dalton said at a news conference. ``Any statements like these that can cause harm or grave concern must be addressed as quickly we possibly can.''

Dalton said the case would be handled in juvenile court in neighbouring Atlantic County, where the boy lives. He would not say whether the boy has a criminal record, citing the teen's age, and would not disclose the teen's race, saying that did not factor into the investigation.

The 16-year-old has been charged with harassment and bias intimidation.

Authorities would not say whether the announcement was planned or made impulsively. Police said they were also investigating a teenage boy who accompanied the suspect to the store, but the other boy has not been charged.

Officials for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said the announcement was ``unacceptable,'' and Dalton praised the company for its strong co-operation in the investigation.

``We're pleased this matter is resolved,'' Walmart spokesman David Tovar said in a statement issued after the news conference. ``We have updated our intercom system at this store to prevent this from happening again. We again apologize to all of our customers and associates who had to listen to something so offensive.''

Although a manager quickly went on the intercom system and apologized for the remark, many customers expressed their anger to store management. Some community members said Saturday that they've heard reports of similar incidents happening at the store in recent months that were not reported to police.

``We are concerned about that, and we're looking into these incidents. We want to work with the community to make sure these types of incidents don't happen,'' said Loretta Winters, president of the Gloucester County chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

Winters said she hopes the boy will get counselling and be educated about sensitivity so he can understand the consequences of his actions.

``I'm assuming this person didn't realize how hurtful his comments were,'' she said.

The incident was the latest in a series of problems the retailer has had in its dealings with minorities and women.

There have been several past instances of black customers claiming they were treated unfairly at Walmart stores, and the company faced lawsuits alleging that women were passed over in favour of men for pay raises and promotions.

In February 2009, the retailer paid $17.5 million to settle a class action lawsuit alleging racial discrimination in its hiring of truck drivers.

And the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued the company in May 2009, claiming some Hispanic employees at a Sam's Club subsidiary in California were subjected to a hostile work environment. That suit alleges managers failed to stop repeated verbal harassment, including the use of derogatory words, against employees of Mexican descent.

However, the NAACP has said the company has worked hard in recent years to show it cares about diversity.

Other racial taunts reported at Turnersville Wal-Mart

Washington Township police are widening their inquiry into racial incidents at the Turnersville Wal-Mart after the arrest of a juvenile on charges of harassment and bias intimidation, Chief Rafael Muniz said yesterday.

At a noon news conference, Muniz and Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean Dalton announced that they had arrested a 16-year-old Atlantic County boy accused of using a store telephone in the home-and-garden section last Sunday to announce over the public-address system: "Attention, Wal-Mart shoppers: Will all the black people please leave the store. Thank you."

Officials declined to describe the boy's race and said he was in his parents' custody.

Gloucester County NAACP leaders, who attended the news conference, said they had been told of two other recent incidents at the Wal-Mart, on Route 42.

On Wednesday, a man called the store and asked Wal-Mart to tell African Americans to leave. And someone used the store's public-address system several months ago, too, to ask African Americans to leave, they said.

Muniz said he was seeking a warrant to go through Wal-Mart's telephone records to verify and trace the Wednesday call.

Police and the Prosecutor's Office are also investigating whether the boy's 16-year-old companion, also from Atlantic County, was involved last Sunday.

If he were an adult, the arrested boy could serve up to 18 months in jail if convicted. As a juvenile, he would likely receive counseling and maybe a brief stay in a juvenile facility, Dalton said.

The boy was arrested late Friday after Muniz put his 13-member detective staff on the case.

The police were joined by county detectives.

The incident Wednesday was reported by Terence Jones, chairman of the NAACP chapter's fact-finding committee. At 12:21 p.m. that day, he said, a person called the Turnersville Wal-Mart and said, "You need to get the n- out of Wal-Mart right now."

Jones also said that about three or four months ago at the 24-hour superstore, someone had commandeered the public-address system about 2:30 a.m. and asked African Americans to leave.

Muniz said Wal-Mart had not reported either of those incidents to the police.

Jones said that because no official reports had been made, "it seems like Wal-Mart just brushed this under the rug."

"We're pleased this matter is resolved," said David Tovar, Wal-Mart senior director for media relations and digital communications. "We have updated our intercom system at this store to prevent this from happening again. We again apologize to all of our customers and associates who had to listen to something so offensive."

Muniz said Wal-Mart had been invited to send a representative to the news conference.

None attended to answer reporters' questions.

Gloucester County NAACP president Loretta Winters, who attended the news conference, said she was happy that Wal-Mart had turned over videotapes, which helped police investigate.

But, she said, she was not pleased that Wal-Mart had not reported the other two incidents to police.

"If something had been reported before, we may not be standing here right now," she said.

Witnesses to the documented incident last Sunday said store officials had taken about five minutes before apologizing and announcing that the offensive utterance was not an official Wal-Mart statement.

On its Web site, Wal-Mart said that the announcement probably had not been made by an employee and that it had updated its phone system so that a customer cannot access the public-address system again.

Muniz and Dalton said Wal-Mart had been helpful in tracking down the arrested boy by turning over hours of store surveillance tapes. The boy was caught on one of the tapes.

Combing through Facebook also aided the investigation, officials said. Teenagers who knew the accused were gossiping on the Internet social-networking site, police said.

Winters, of the NAACP, said she would talk to Wal-Mart about setting up sensitivity training.

"Hopefully, they will welcome us in," she said.

Boy, 16, Is Charged in Wal-Mart Race Bias Case

WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. -- The authorities in southern New Jersey said Saturday that they had arrested a 16-year-old boy for activating a public-address system at a Wal-Mart store last week and ordering ''all black people'' to leave.

The boy, from Atlantic County, was charged by Gloucester County authorities with bias and intimidation and harassment in connection with the episode last Sunday. If convicted, he could face up to a year in a juvenile detention center, officials said. His name was not released because he is a minor.

According to the police, the boy picked up a public-address telephone in the Wal-Mart in Washington Township, one of two dozen accessible to the store's customers, and said, ''All black people, leave the store now.''

A store manager quickly apologized over the public-address system, witnesses said, and the police and the store opened separate investigations that included a review of images captured by the store's security cameras.

Rafael Muniz, the Washington Township police chief, said that while the cameras did not record anyone speaking on the public-address system, images showed three people -- the suspect, a young man and a woman -- standing near the phone just before the announcement, and rushing from the store just after.

Investigators also scoured Facebook, MySpace and YouTube, and found postings, including some that the police chief said involved ''kids bragging'' about what happened.

With the help of anonymous tipsters, he added, investigators were led to the suspect, who was arrested Friday.

''We got lucky,'' Chief Muniz said Saturday at a news conference.

The police would not disclose any details about the suspect, including his race.

In the course of their inquiry, investigators said they discovered at least two similar occurrences at the store in recent months.

The store's parent company, Wal-Mart Stores, issued a statement saying it had modified its intercom system at the store to prevent such breaches.

Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, has a history of discrimination and labor complaints involving minorities and women, though in recent years it has redoubled its efforts to promote diversity at its stores.

Last year, the company agreed to pay $17.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that accused it of discriminating against blacks applying for jobs as truck drivers.

News of the arrest circulated among the customers at the Washington Township store on Saturday afternoon.

Paulette Duckrey, 43, who is black, said that when she heard about the episode, she guessed that it was a prank by a customer.

''I assumed it couldn't have been an employee,'' she said.

WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. - A 16-year-old boy patronizing a Walmart store in southern New Jersey took over the public- address system and ordered black people to leave, angering customers and prompting company executives to apologize, police said Saturday.

Wal-Mart 'All black people leave' arrest a media wake-up call

In the last week, both Toyota and Wal-Mart bore the the brunt of alleged consumer skulduggery. Critics say the media is more gullible than most Americans when it comes to reporting stories like the racist PA announcement or the runaway Prius.

The arrest of a 16-year-old Washington Township, N.J., boy for saying "All black people, leave the store now" over a Wal-Mart public-address system is, in retrospect, in the same family of ill- considered pranks that might've been used by a member of the Brat Pack in a 1980s John Hughes film.

But days after a government statement that at least one report of a runway Toyota Prius was also, if not a prank, at least solely driver error, the Wal-Mart arrest shows that, in some cases of apparent corporate negligence or even racism, the media could use a little more skepticism.

"Journalism schools are supposed to teach that skepticism is paramount," writes Michael Fumento, director of the nonprofit Independent Journalism Project, about a questionable claim of a stuck Toyota gas pedal in California. "Yet comments on Web sites across the country reveal that practically everyone thought the Prius incident was a hoax - though they couldn't prove it - except for the media."

Police booked the Wal-Mart prankster, who was not named, on charges of harassment and bias intimidation, which could land him a year in juvenile detention. Police did not give the race of the boy.

Satuday's arrest shows how consumer pranksters can unfairly kick a company even when it's down, creating a public relations disaster and costing a corporation dearly even when it's done nothing at all wrong.

Many media outlets quickly assumed the worst in the Wal-Mart incident. Gothamist ran the headline, "More racism at Walmart, this time over PA system."

Mr. Fumento writes that the lack of skepticism about another recent claim of a runaway Toyota, this one in California, is "stunning." In the California incident, a man traveled for 20 minutes at high speed, unable, he claimed, to brake or shut his Prius down, before a police officer in a cruiser helped him come to a stop. The investigation into that case is still ongoing.

Claiming that the man's story doesn't make sense, Fumento writes, "It's a Toyota media feeding frenzy and the media aren't about to let little things like incredible stories and readily-refutable claims get in the way."

That's not to say corporations don't invite media criticism - and even hoaxes. So far, accelerator problems have been tied to 52 deaths in the US, and Toyota's sales numbers are down by over 10 percent over the last month after its largest-ever recall.

In Wal-Mart's case, the Arkansas-based company paid a $17.5 million settlement last year brought by black truck drivers who claimed the company discriminated against them. The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission also sued Wal-Mart in 2009 over racial insults coming from fellow employees.

Since then, Wal-Mart's approval numbers among consumers has been rising, especially as it makes a push into urban areas.

The "All black people leave now" prank is at least the second hoax in the last few months directed at Wal-Mart.

Late last year, Wal-Mart faced a social media hoax after news outlets began reporting a faux press release announcing that Wal- Mart had begun selling caskets online, sparking "a few clever folks [to start] writing fictitious (yet highly entertaining} comments about the products on Walmart.com," writes Ad Age's Craig Daitch. "The hilarity of the reviews began to border on the absurd."

In that case, Wal-Mart took down the faux reviews. After Saturday's arrest, the company announced it would work to limit shoppers' access to in-store PA systems.

WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. - Police have arrested a 16-year-old boy in the case of a racial comment that was made over the public-address system at a Walmart store in southern New Jersey.

Police said Saturday the Atlantic County teenager was arrested Friday on charges of harassment and bias intimidation. They say he's been released to the custody of his parents.

The incident happened Sunday evening when a male voice came over the Walmart public address system and calmly announced: ``Attention, Walmart customers: All black people, leave the store now.'' The announcement provoked an immediate apology from the store manager.

Authorities aren't releasing the boy's name because he's a juvenile, and they don't know whether he has an attorney.

The 16-year-old has been charged with harassment and bias intimidation.

Authorities would not say whether the announcement was planned or made impulsively. Police said they were also investigating a teenage boy who accompanied the suspect to the store, but the other boy has not been charged.

Officials for Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said the announcement was "unacceptable," and Dalton praised the company for its strong cooperation in the investigation.

"We're pleased this matter is resolved," Walmart spokesman David Tovar said in a statement issued after the news conference. "We have updated our intercom system at this store to prevent this from happening again. We again apologize to all of our customers and associates who had to listen to something so offensive."

Although a manager quickly went on the intercom system and apologized for the remark, many customers expressed their anger to store management.

"We are concerned about that, and we're looking into these incidents. We want to work with the community to make sure these types of incidents don't happen," said Loretta Winters, president of the Gloucester County chapter of the NAACP.

Winters said she hopes the boy will get counseling and be educated about sensitivity so he can understand the consequences of his actions.

Statement from the UFCW Minority Coalition on Walmart’s Pattern of Race-Based Incidents

LANDOVER, Md. - (BUSINESS WIRE) - The Minority Coalition of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) is calling for an internal company-wide review of all Walmart operations after a racially-motivated incident traumatized customers at a New Jersey Supercenter.

On March 14, 2010, customers at the Walmart in Washington Township, New Jersey were shocked to hear, over the store announcement system, “Attention Walmart Customers: All black people leave the store now.” Offended customers have promised not to return to the store.

“It’s never been more important for citizens to support businesses that respect our communities,” said Don Cash, President of the UFCW Minority Coalition. “Walmart needs to examine all of its operations – from public access to its store announcement system to its pricing, online marketing, hiring and sourcing practices – to ensure that no racially-biased actions occur in the company.”

The New Jersey incident is under investigation by public safety officials and Walmart. In the meantime, the African-American community is offended by the retail giant’s pattern of racial incidents.

* Last month, Walmart was exposed for selling black Barbie Dolls for half the price of white Barbies.

* In 2006, Walmart’s online presence suggested people who bought “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” and “Planet of the Apes” might also be interested in "Martin Luther King: I Have A Dream/Assassination of MLK" and "Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson."

* In 2008, the NAACP took issue with Walmart and called on the retailer to address discriminatory practices.

* In July 2009, Wal-Mart settled a $17.5 million class action litigation with 4,500 workers charging the company with systematically discriminating against African-Americans applying for truck driver positions.

* In May 2009, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) sued Wal-Mart subsidiary Sam’s Club for racial harassment of Latinos in Fresno, California for subjecting Latino employees to repeated verbal harassment and derogatory names.

“We spend our money with companies that we feel promote the value of diversity and community. Walmart seems to be tone-deaf to the issues facing a large segment of its customer-base,” continued Cash.

The UFCW Minority Coalition develops a unified voice, and promotes diversity and inclusion within the labor movement.

Victoria Arter was stunned by the loudspeaker announcement.

"Attention, Wal-Mart shoppers," she recalled hearing the calm male voice begin. "Will all the black people please leave the store. Thank you."

Her shock turned to anger, Arter said, when more than five awkward and frightening minutes elapsed before management at the Wal-Mart in Turnersville came on the public address system.

"We waited and waited. Some people just left their carts in disgust and said they couldn't believe it," said Arter, an African American woman who was shopping at the store on Route 42 when the announcement was made shortly before 7 p.m. Sunday.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is cooperating with the Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office and Washington Township police, which are investigating the event as a possible racial-intimidation crime. More than 10 African Americans have signed a complaint with police.

"We're just as appalled by this as anyone," said Ashley Hardie, a spokeswoman for the discount-store chain, "and anyone who did this was wrong."

Law enforcement is examining surveillance tapes inside the store. But the P.A. system can be accessed from 25 telephones in the building, and not all are within camera range, said Bernie Weisenfeld, spokesman for the prosecutor.

The 24-hour superstore has about 700 employees, many of them part-time, and some of the store's phones are accessible to the public, Weisenfeld said.

Last year, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charged Sam's Club, which is owned by Wal-Mart, with violating federal law by allowing a work environment hostile to Latino employees. Since the 1990s, the EEOC has filed about 60 additional discrimination actions against Wal-Mart.

"This is despicable," Phil Warner, coordinator of the NAACP's chapters in South Jersey, said of the announcement. "It's 2010, and we're still facing those issues."

Warner said he hoped Wal-Mart would take quick action if the person responsible for the announcement can be identified.

"Whether it was a prank or whether it was serious, the level of insensitivity is apparent and is a reminder there's still a need for people to work toward decency and equality," said James E. Harris, president of the New Jersey NAACP Conference.

Shortly before police arrived at the Wal-Mart, an assistant manager broadcast an apology to customers still in the store.

Arter, an assistant bank manager from Sicklerville who said she has frequently shopped at the Wal-Mart, said she was still upset by Sunday's events and was boycotting the store.

After it happened, said Arter, 29, the whole store fell quiet. Then people got on their cell phones, she said. Soon, customers were asking the management for answers.

The incident could have ended much worse, she said.

"It could have led to violence," Arter said. "It could have triggered someone who was having a bad day. I don't want to be an innocent bystander to something because of someone's not-so-funny joke."

Thousands of temporary workers in the food industry will now receive pay equal to that of permanent staff under a deal agreed between Asda and Unite union.

Asda, the UK's second-largest supermarket, has added pressure on other food retailers to follow suit by urging that suppliers pay agency workers the same rate as permanent employees, before a European directive that takes effect late next year.

Unite said 6,000 workers, who were mostly migrants, would win improved pay under the agreement, which covers 29 suppliers.

Asda will now liaise with the suppliers, agencies that provide migrant workers and unions to raise the £2.4m needed to ensure that temporary workers were on the same rates as their permanent colleagues, the Times has reported.

Unite said the pay gap led to tensions in communities as permanent staff accused migrants of bringing down wages, while temporary workers felt aggrieved that they were underpaid for doing the same job as colleagues with contracts.

An Asda spokesman said: "Following our own investigation into working conditions in the meat sector, we agreed with Unite that agency workers who do the same work as permanent workers should receive equal pay, and that agency work should not be used as a means of preventing them from accessing the same rights as permanent workers.

"As a result, we brought all our suppliers together as a group and presented both Unite's findings and the results of our own investigation."

Jack Dromey, deputy general secretary of Unite, said of the announcement: "It sends a clear message that one of Britain's biggest supermarkets is determined to put ethical principles into practice. For years, tens of thousands of workers have paid the price of discriminatory and unfair practices and poorer conditions of employment."

The move by Asda comes ahead of a report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission inquiry into discrimination in the meat and poultry sector.

Poultry industry workers get a helping hand

SUPERMARKET giant Asda has joined forces with the United union to improve working conditions for workers in the meat and poultry industry.

Owned by American giantWall-Mart, the firm and the workers union have launched a groundbreaking joint initiative to end discrimination and unfair treatment across the supermarket's 29 meat and poultry suppliers, employing 6,000 workers.

Asda, which has a store in Linwood Road, Paisley, says its aim has been to move to a new business model of supply chain management which is efficient, effective and crucially which ensures workers are treated fairly and equally.

Unite has criticised the way in which supermarkets abuse their market power to drive down costs along the supply chain, leading to a twotier labour market, with agency workers, overwhelmingly migrant, on poorer conditions of employment and the directly-employed workers, overwhelmingly indigenous, on better conditions of employment.

Unite's Deputy General Secretary, Jack Dromey, said: "We welcome Asda's pioneering initiative which sends a clear message that one of Britain's biggest supermarkets is determined to put ethical principles into practice.

"For years, supermarkets have driven down costs along their supply chain with tens of thousands of workers paying the price with discriminatory and unfair practices. It is wrong to exploit migrant agency workers on poorer conditions of employment and it is wrong to undercut directly employed workers on better conditions of employment. That divides workforces and damages communities."

Morrisons has underlined its commitment to the fair treatment of its workforce and those of its suppliers.

The Bradford-based supermarketgroup, whose new chief executive Dalton Phillips is due to start this month, has reacted to an initiative on equal treatment of mainly foreign seasonal workers by rival Asda.

The US-owned stores group launched a joint initiative with the Unite union to end discrimination and unfair treatment across Asda’s 29 meat and poultry suppliers, employing 6,000 workers.

Unite said it was a breakthrough and accused other supermarkets of paying lip service to ethical issues.

But Morrisons claims it was the first supermarket to audit working practices in conjunction with Fair Working Conditions, a body which promotes, measures and formally certifies best employment practices.

A Morrisons spokesman said: “We aim to ensure and apply consistent and fair working practices across our entire workforce, including temporary workers. Working conditions are a key focus for us and we require our suppliers to be compliant with our Ethical Trading Code which covers matters such as, wages, working conditions freedom of association and non discrimination.”

The FWC approach was built on the principles of the International Labour Organisation and Ethical Trading Initiative.

It involved a ballot of workers to decide whether the employer merited approval. Unite and Asda met all 29 of the supermarket’s suppliers, ranging from multi-nationals to local firms with the aim of establishing a new model which ensured workers were treated fairly and equally. Unite has criticised the way in which supermarkets abuse their market power to drive down costs along the supply chain, leading to a two-tier labour market.

Unite said its work with the EHRC had established clear evidence of unfair treatment of workers Asda had examined in detail the practices of its suppliers and acted to end unfair practices.

Jack Dromey, Unite’s deputy general secretary, said: “We warmly welcome Asda’s pioneering initiative which sends a clear message that one of Britain’s biggest supermarkets is determined to put ethical principles into practice”

DETROIT—The nation's top employment cops have Wal-Mart Stores Inc. digging deeply into its pockets again, this time to settle allegations of sex discrimination.

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission announced on March 1 that the retail giant will pay more than $12 million to resolve claims that for years it denied jobs to female applicants at a distribution center in London, Ky.

Wal-Mart will pay $11.7 million in back wages and compensatory damages, its share of employer taxes and up to $250,000 in administrative fees.

Wal-Mart is required to provide jobs as they become available to eligible and interested female class members.

Asda and workers union Unite have launched a joint initiative to change the way more than 6,000 staff are employed across the supermarket's 29 meat and poultry suppliers.

Unite has regularly criticised the way supermarkets drive down costs along the supply chain, claiming that they create a two-tier labour market and leave agency workers on poorer terms of employment.

But as part of the new initiative, agency workers and the directly employed will be paid equally. A second objective is to maximise direct employment, ending the sometimes semi-permanent status of agency workers. In future the, agency work will be undertaken chiefly to meet seasonal fluctuations.

"We warmly welcome Asda's pioneering initiative," said Unite's deputy general secretary Jack Dromey. "For years, supermarkets have driven down costs along their supply chain with tens of thousands of workers paying the price with discriminatory and unfair practices.

"It is wrong to exploit migrant agency workers on poorer conditions of employment and it is wrong to undercut directly employed workers on better conditions of employment. That divides workforces and damages social cohesion in local communities."

Asda said it had been quick to act when Unite raised concerns. "Our suppliers have all responded well to the challenge of ensuring equal pay and permanency for agency workers. We'd encourage other retailers to engage with both Unite and their supply bases to face these important issues."

Asda and Unite to tackle migrant    discrimination

Supermarket giant will require its suppliers to stop practice of paying migrants less than native workers

The supermarket group Asda announced today that it has reached agreement with the union Unite to tackle discrimination against migrant workers in its UK meat and poultry factories.

Under the deal Asda will require its suppliers to stop the practice of paying migrants less than indigenous employees for the same work and to eradicate the culture of bullying and harassment that has characterised much of the industry.

The move comes as the leading supermarkets brace themselves for the results of an inquiry by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) into conditions in the UK meat sector.

The EHRC's report, due this month, is expected to be highly damaging to the reputation of both the supermarkets and their suppliers.

It is thought it will confirm that discrimination, which has fuelled racial tensions, is rife in chicken and red meat factories around the country.

Ahead of the report, Marks & Spencer has also been piloting an "ethical model factory" with one of its chicken suppliers.

The deal with Asda however marks a breakthrough for the union, as it covers the whole of Asda's meat supply chain of 29 companies.

Asda says it will require its suppliers to create permanent jobs for agency workers after a fixed period and to pay them equally for the same work.

It has also brought all its meat suppliers together to address unacceptable practices raised by the unions: these include migrants having to clock off for unpaid toilet breaks, and being required to "hot boot" with other shift workers rather than being supplied with their own safety boots.

Unite estimates that around 6,000 workers, most of them migrants, could win better rates of pay as the agreement is implemented.

The UK will eventually be bound by the new EU Working Time Directive that aims to end inequalities between permanent and temporary labour, but British companies have been allowed by the government until the end of 2011, the longest permitted time, to implement it.

Asda has chosen to move ahead of the legal requirement.

Unite has conducted an unprecedented campaign since 2005 to organise all workers in the sector, both migrant and indigenous.

It says that when it began the recruitment drive,an estimated 40% of workers in the UK meat sector were agency workers, most of them migrants, even in off-peak periods, and union membership was low.

Over 26,000 out of a UK total of 45,000 meat workers are now members of Unite. In five years the union has won recognition for collective bargaining in 89% of poultry factories and 61% of red meat factories.

Unite's deputy general secretary, Jack Dromey, welcomed Asda's initiative. "For years, supermarkets have driven down costs with tens of thousands of workers paying the price with discriminatory and unfair practices that divide workforces. Asda has not waited for the EHRC report but has acted. It is a matter of regret that for most of Asda's competitors the word "ethical" is but a logo on the letterhead which is not put seriously into practice."

'It's 2010 this shouldn't be happening'; Blind woman angry over hassles at local Wal-Mart, but store says guide dog wasn't wearing service vest

Judy Germain has grown tired of the unwelcome "greeting" she says she and her guide dog receive at her local Wal-Mart.

Germain, who is blind, uses Mr. Jones - a yellow Labrador and golden retriever cross - to get around. She says she is rarely troubled when entering buildings that prohibit other animals, except when she shops at the Wal-Mart store at Islington Ave. and Highway 401.

"It's 2010 - this shouldn't be happening," says Germain, 49. "It's degrading, it's frustrating, and it's embarrassing."

The store says it's simply a misunderstanding, and that Mr. Jones was not immediately recognized as a service dog because he was not wearing a service-dog vest.

In Canada, guide dogs are allowed anywhere people are.

Germain says the store's trademark greeters have stopped her and Mr. Jones eight or nine times in the last year, telling her they are not allowed into the store. On every occasion, Germain says, she speaks to a manager who allows her to continue shopping. When it happened again on Wednesday, Germain says she had had enough.

Officers at Toronto Police's 23 Division confirmed Thursday that Germain filed a report of Wednesday's incident with them.

Store manager Hamid Chaudry said that, since the first incident with Germain last year, the store's staff have been trained to recognize guide dogs.

"When we questioned the greeter last night, he did not recognize (Mr. Jones) as a guide dog," Chaudry said.

"The dog was not fully equipped as a guide dog should be."

Chaudry says Germain has been stopped two or three times.

Germain, 49, was born with impaired vision. She says she was wearing a jacket with a Guide Dogs Canada logo Wednesday night, and was using a guide-dog harness to walk Mr. Jones.

Andrew Pelletier, vice-president of Wal-Mart Canada's corporate affairs, said the company's head office will review the incident.

"Anybody who knows Wal-Mart knows that we're committed to providing a welcome shopping environment to all of our clients."

He said Wal-Mart is a large employer of people with special needs and he has never heard of any incident of discrimination involving service dogs.

Germain says she just wants to shop without worrying if she's going to be harassed when she walks through the front doors.

"It's frustrating to walk into Wal-Mart and wonder, 'Is it going to happen this time?'"

Anyone found guilty of discriminating against the use of a specially trained guide dog in a public place can be fined a maximum of $5,000.

Thousands of temporary workers in the food industry will win pay equal to that of permanent staff under a landmark deal struck between Asda and the Unite union.

Asda, Britain's second-largest supermarket, heaped pressure on other grocers to follow suit yesterday by insisting that suppliers pay agency workers the same rate as permanent employees, before a European directive that takes effect late next year. Unite said that 6,000 workers, mostly migrants, would win improved pay under the agreement, which covers 29 leading suppliers.

The union said that Asda would liaise with the suppliers, agencies that provide migrant workers and unions to plug the £2.4 million needed to ensure that temporary workers were on the same rates as their permanent colleagues.

Tesco's treatment of temporary workers was attacked by unions and shareholders last year at its annual meeting. Unite has blamed food retailers for fostering a "two-tier" labour system that discriminates against migrants. Agency workers, typically from Eastern Europe, are paid between 30p and £1 an hour less than permanent staff for doing the same job, the union said.

Unite, Britain's biggest union, claimed that the pay gap had led to unrest in communities as permanent staff accused migrants of bringing down wages, while temporary workers felt aggrieved that they were underpaid for doing the same job as colleagues with contracts.

The move comes ahead of a report from the Equality and Human Rights Commission inquiry into discrimination in the meat and poultry market. The food industry has in principle accepted the European directive stipulating equal pay between temporary workers and permanent staff.

A spokesman for the Food and Drink Federation, the industry's trade body, said: "We applaud any initiative that attempts to tackle discrimination and unfair treatment of workers. Our members fully support equal pay for agency workers and have accepted the Temporary Workers Directive's principles.

Our chief concern is the additional administrative burden this legislation will have on employers."

An Asda spokesman said: "Following our own investigation into working conditions in the meat sector, we agreed with Unite that agency workers who do the same work as permanent workers should receive equal pay, and that agency work should not be used as a means of preventing them from accessing the same rights as permanent workers.

For years, tens of thousands of workers have paid the price of discriminatory and unfair practices and poorer conditions of employment."

A Tesco spokesman said: "We have co-operated closely with the Equality and Human Rights Commission inquiry into the meat processing industry and look forward to hearing its recommendations on March 16. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure that agency workers are treated decently and share good practice."

Workers' rights

Measures to give temporary workers the same rights as permanent staff were agreed at an EU meeting in Luxembourg in 2008

The Agency Workers Directive affects temporary staff who are employed by a hiring company, rather than the company they directly work for

Temporary staff can be full-time or part-time. Under the directive, they will accrue holiday and sick pay rights after being employed for more than 12 weeks and enjoy the same rate of pay as permanent staff

The treatment of agency workers in the meat and poultry industry is a reverse of the controversy in the NHS, which has been accused of squandering millions of pounds on temporary staff

The NHS paid agency staff up to £400 an hour, adding up to £1.3 billion a year, with temporary nurses earning up to £146 an hour in 2008 — ten times the pay of salaried nurses. NHS spending on agency workers rose 60 per cent in the two years to 2008

Asda union deal will improve conditions for agency staff

BRITAIN'S biggest union and supermarket giant Asda yesterday announced a "groundbreaking" initiative which officials said would improve conditions for thousands of workers.

The Unite union said the aim was to end discrimination and unfair treatment across the Asda's 29 meat and poultry suppliers, employing 6,000 workers.

The union has accused some supermarkets of "abusing" their market power, claiming a two-tier labour market existed, agency staff being on poorer employment conditions than directly-employed workers.

The union said yesterday's move was aimed at ensuring agency staff were paid the same rate as other workers, as well as ending their "semi-permanent" employment status.

Unite's deputy general secretary, Jack Dromey said: "We warmly welcome Asda's pioneering initiative which sends a clear message that one of Britain's biggest supermarkets is determined to put ethical principles into practice.

"For years, supermarkets have driven down costs along their supply chain, tens of thousands of workers paying the price with discriminatory and unfair practices.

"It is wrong to exploit migrant agency workers on poorer conditions of employment and it is wrong to undercut directly employed workers on better conditions of employment. That divides workforces and damages social cohesion in local communities."

An Asda spokesman said: "We believe actions always speak louder than words – that's why when Unite raised concerns a year or so ago we were quick to act.

"Following our own investigation into working conditions in the meat sector, we agreed with Unite that agency workers who do the same work as permanent workers should receive equal pay, and that agency work should not be used as a means of preventing them from accessing the same rights as permanent workers.

"As a result we brought all our suppliers together as a group and presented both Unite's findings and the results of our own investigation. We then met with individual suppliers to discuss the steps they could take to resolve these points of concern."

Unite and ASDA Launch Ground Breaking Initiative to Improve Working Conditions for Thousands

LONDON, March 4, 2010 /PRNewswire/ --

Unite the Union and ASDA supermarket chain, will today (4th March) launch a groundbreaking joint initiative to end discrimination and unfair treatment across the supermarket's 29 meat and poultry suppliers, employing 6000 workers.

Unite and ASDA have worked together, including meeting with all 29 of the suppliers to the supermarket, which range from major multi-nationals to local suppliers. The aim has been to move to a new business model of supply chain management which is efficient, effective and crucially which ensures workers are treated fairly and equally.

Unite has criticised the way in which supermarkets abuse their market power to drive down costs along the supply chain, leading to a two-tier labour market, with agency workers, overwhelmingly migrant, on poorer conditions of employment and the directly-employed workers, overwhelmingly indigenous, on better conditions of employment. That structural discrimination is currently the subject of the first inquiry by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) which is due to report in March on the UK's multi-billion pound meat industry in England and Wales.

The work by Unite the Union and the EHRC has established clear evidence of unfair treatment of workers and sometimes serious division in workforces that can damage social cohesion in local communities. ASDA has itself examined in detail the practices in its supply chain, deciding that its customers would demand nothing less than action to ensure fair and equal treatment of all workers.

Central to the joint initiative by Unite and ASDA are agency workers and the directly-employed being paid the same rate of pay. A second key objective has been to maximise direct employment, ending the sometimes semi-permanent status of agency workers with, in future, agency working being undertaken only to meet seasonal fluctuations and no longer a way of life. In addition, in their dialogue with the 29 suppliers, Unite and ASDA have identified unacceptable practices which ASDA has acted to bring to an end.

Unite's Deputy General Secretary, Jack Dromey today said:

"We warmly welcome ASDA's pioneering initiative which sends a clear message that one of Britain's biggest supermarkets is determined to put ethical principles into practice. ASDA's customers can be confident that there really is no place like ASDA.

"For years, supermarkets have driven down costs along their supply chain with tens of thousands of workers paying the price with discriminatory and unfair practices. It is wrong to exploit migrant agency workers on poorer conditions of employment and it is wrong to undercut directly employed workers on better conditions of employment. That divides workforces and damages social cohesion in local communities.

"The EHRC will report shortly on the outcome of its first ever inquiry into structural discrimination in the supermarket supply chain in the UK. ASDA has not waited, but instead has acted. It is a matter of regret that, for most of ASDA's competitors, the word "ethical" is but a logo on the letterhead which is not put seriously into practice."

ASDA DEMANDS EQUAL PAY FOR TEMPORARY STAFF

Asda , the UK's second-largest supermarket, has struck a landmark deal with the Unite union, committing 29 leading suppliers to pay temporary workers the same rate as permanent employees. It is also putting pressure on other grocers to do the same. Supermarket giant Tesco was criticised at its annual meeting last year for its treatment of temporary workers, with food retailers in general accused of fostering a labour system that "discriminates against migrants" according to Unite. A Tesco spokesman said the retailer has worked closely with the recent Equality and Human Rights Commission investigation and strives to "ensure that agency workers are treated decently and share good practice".

KIRSH SET TO RENEW BATTLE WITH MINERVA

South African entrepreneur Nathan Kirsh looks set to oppose the appointment of Oliver Whitehead as chairman of Minerva for a second time. Kirsh, who owns 29.9 percent of the property developer, successfully voted out Whitehead in December although he was immediately reappointed by Minerva, which described Kirsh's tactics as "deliberately disruptive". In a statement, Kirsh's vehicle Kifin said: "Following the general meeting, irrespective of the outcome, Kifin will engage directly with other shareholders in relation to its concerns about the governance and strategic direction of Minerva."

Wal-Mart Settles Gender    Discrimination  Complaint

NEW YORK -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. agreed to pay about $12 million in back wages and damages as well as hire more female applicants for warehouse jobs to settle a sex discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency announced Tuesday.

Wal-Mart's London, Ky., distribution center denied jobs to qualified female applicants from 1998 through February 2005, and regularly hired male entry-level applicants for warehouse positions, the EEOC said.

"Wal-Mart regularly used gender stereotypes" for filling certain positions, the EEOC said in a statement.

Executives with hiring authority told applicants that order-filling positions were not suitable for women, and that they hired mainly 18- to 25-year-old men, the EEOC said. Excluding women from employment or excluding them from certain positions because of gender violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

As part of the settlement, Wal-Mart agreed to pay $11.7 million in back wages and compensatory damages; its share of employer taxes; and up to $250,000 in administration fees. The settlement also requires Wal-Mart to provide order-filler jobs, as they become available, to eligible and interested female class members, as determined by a claims administrator.

"We're pleased the matter has been resolved," said Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Rossiter. "The claims do not reflect Wal-Mart's continuing commitment to build an even more inclusive workplace through hiring and training initiatives."

Asda agency staff score workers' rights victory

Union reps have stepped up the pressure on supermarket bosses exploiting agency staff after signing a breakthrough deal on workers' rights with Asda stores.

The agreement between Unite and the huge food store chain - owned by the notorious US Wal-Mart corporation - aims to end the discrimination suffered by thousands of meat and poultry workers labouring for the supermarket's suppliers.

The union's three-year organising campaign among abattoir and meat-processing workers exposed what Unite assistant general secretary Jack Dromey described as "harsh and divisive conditions" in the companies that produc meat for high street supermarkets.

"In many cases, a permanent two-tier workforce had been created, one where mainly migrant agency workers are on even lower pay and worse conditions than the directly employed workers," he explained.

Although the government has finally introduced a long-awaited agency worker law that for the first time will give staff the right to the same pay and holidays as other employees, the new rights will only apply if the workers have been in the job longer than three months.

The new law also fails to give agency workers the same pension, sick pay and maternity leave rights as the directly employed staff they work alongside doing the same job.

However Unite's agreement with Asda will allow the union to bring an end to what Mr Dromey described as the "semi-permanent employment status" of more than 6,000 agency workers in the meat industry.

"For years supermarkets have driven down costs, with thousands of workers paying the price with discriminatory practices," he stressed.

"It is wrong to exploit migrant agency workers on poorer conditions of employment and it is wrong to undercut directly employed workers on better conditions - that divides the workforce," Mr Dromey added.

An investigation into discrimination in the meat industry by the Equality and Human Rights Commission is due to report later this month and Mr Dromey welcomed Asda bosses' decision to "act and not wait" for the results of the inquiry.

"It is a matter of regret that for most of Asda's competitors the word 'ethical' is not put seriously into practice," he added.

Wal-Mart Stores has said it has settled a sexual discrimination lawsuit it was facing over application and transfer requests at its Walmart Distribution Center in London, Kentucky.

The case, which was filed in the name of former Walmart associate Janice Smith by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2001, alleged that the company based hiring decisions at the centre on gender from 1998 to February 2005.

It sought back pay for those females not selected for hire or transfer during that time, plus compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief. The case was scheduled to begin trial on 1 March 2010.

The company said that it had settled to the tune of approximately US$12m. In addition, the company has agreed to certain enhancements of its hiring and training measures at the London, Kentucky, Distribution Center, and to make a specified number of positions at the Distribution Center available to female applicants.

The settlement will not result in any charge to the company's results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2011.

"The company is pleased that this matter has been resolved. This case does not reflect Walmart's continuing commitment to build an even more diverse and inclusive workplace through hiring and training initiatives. Walmart respects and values the unique talents each associate contributes to the company's ability to make a difference in the lives of our customers," a statement said.

Wal-Mart to pay nearly $12M in EEOC sex- discrimination  case

Wal-Mart Stores will pay nearly $12 million and change its hiring practices to settle a sex-discrimination suit over hiring at an eastern Kentucky warehouse, the Associated Press reported.

The retailer reached the deal with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Monday, when a trial was set to open in a nine-year-old lawsuit alleging Wal-Mart illegally based hiring decisions on gender, bypassing women for jobs at its London regional distribution center. The EEOC announced the agreement late Monday.

The EEOC filed a class-action suit against Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart in 2001, alleging it hired 18 to 25-year-old men instead of women for jobs in the warehouse and routinely told applicants that order-filling positions were not suitable for women.

Wal-Mart denied the charges. The settlement, approved by U.S. District Judge Karen Caldwell on Monday, covers all hires at the London warehouse between 1998 and 2005.

Wal-Mart, in a written statement, confirmed the settlement and said it will not result in any change to the company's operating results in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, which started Feb. 1.

The $12 million payment will be split among a yet-to-be determined number of claimants, who will receive $8.4 million in back pay, with another $3.2 million in compensatory damages. The EEOC will determine which claimants receive back pay and which will get compensatory damages.

Anyone receiving $100,000 or more will not be eligible for hire under the settlement terms. Wal-Mart will also pay $250,000 in administration costs related to the settlement.

Along with the back pay and damages, as part of the settlement Wal-Mart will fill the first 50 order-filler jobs at the warehouse with female hires. After that, female hires will make up a fixed percentage of open positions.

Under the terms of the settlement, Wal-Mart will receive a list of eligible applicants from the EEOC and will then fill jobs as they become available.

By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK, March 2 (Reuters Life!) - The world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores, will pay more than $11.7 million to settle a gender discrimination lawsuit.

It is accused of regularly hiring men for warehouse jobs at its London, Kentucky, distribution center from Jan. 1, 1998, through Feb. 15, 2005, and denying jobs to equally or better qualified female applicants.

According to the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commissio, the company hired mainly 18- to 25-year-old men because they believed order-filling positions were not suitable for women. The lawsuit began in August 2001.

Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Rossiter said the claims "do not reflect Wal-Mart's continuing commitment to build an even more inclusive workplace through hiring and training initiatives."

The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.

Wal-Mart is awaiting a ruling by the federal appeals court in San Francisco in a separate lawsuit, over whether to let roughly 2 million current and former female Wal-Mart workers sue the retailer as a group for gender bias.

That lawsuit is the largest alleging sexual discrimination in U.S. history.

In the Kentucky case, Wal-Mart and the EEOC entered a five-year consent decree that was signed by U.S. District Judge Karen Caldwell on Monday.

The decree calls for Wal-Mart to hire women for the next 50 order-filler positions, and offer women half of the following 50 positions and a third of positions thereafter. It also calls for increased training and other remedies.

"The terms of this decree are adequate, fair, reasonable, equitable and just," Caldwell wrote. The monetary terms include $8.41 million of back pay, $3.29 million of compensatory damages, and various fees and employer taxes, the decree said. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, editing by Gerald E.

Executives with hiring authority told applicants that order-filling positions were not suitable for women, and that they hired mainly 18- to 25-year-old men, the EEOC said. Excluding women from employment or excluding them from certain positions because of gender violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

As part of the settlement, Wal-Mart agreed to pay $11.7 million in back wages and compensatory damages; its share of employer taxes; and up to $250,000 in administration fees. The settlement also requires Wal-Mart to provide order-filler jobs, as they become available, to eligible and interested female class members, as determined by a claims administrator.

Wal-Mart to pay $12M in    discrimination  suit

LOUISVILLE, Kentucky (AP) - Wal-Mart Stores will pay nearly $12 million and change its hiring practices to settle a sex-discrimination suit over hiring at a Kentucky warehouse.

The retail giant reached the deal with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Monday, when a trial was set to open in a nine-year-old lawsuit alleging Wal-Mart illegally based hiring decisions on gender, bypassing women for jobs at its London regional distribution center. The EEOC announced the agreement late Monday.

The EEOC filed a class-action suit against Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart in 2001, alleging it hired 18 to 25-year-old men instead of women for jobs in the warehouse and routinely told applicants that order-filling positions were not suitable for women.

Wal-Mart denied the charges. The settlement, approved by U.S. District Judge Karen Caldwell on Monday, covers all hires at the London warehouse between 1998 and 2005.

Wal-Mart, in a written statement, confirmed the settlement and said it will not result in any change to the company's operating results in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, which started Feb. 1.

EEOC Senior Trial Attorney Aimee McFerren of Louisville said the deal levels the playing field for women in eastern Kentucky.

"It is satisfying to know that the EEOC's efforts will allow the women in eastern Kentucky affected by Wal-Mart's discriminatory practices to better themselves and their families," McFerren said.

The $12 million payment will be split among a yet-to-be determined number of claimants, who will receive $8.4 million in back pay, with another $3.2 million in compensatory damages. The EEOC will determine which claimants receive back pay and which will get compensatory damages.

Anyone receiving $100,000 or more will not be eligible for hire under the settlement terms. Wal-Mart will also pay $250,000 in administration costs related to the settlement.

Along with the backpay and damages, as part of the settlement Wal-Mart will fill the first 50 order-filler jobs at the warehouse with female hires. After that, female hires will make up a fixed percentage of open positions.

Under the terms of the settlement, Wal-Mart will receive a list of eligible applicants from the EEOC and will then fill jobs as they become available.

Walmart to Pay More Than $11.7 Million to Settle EEOC Sex    Discrimination  Suit

INDIANAPOLIS, March 1 -- The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued the following news release:

Walmart Stores will pay $11.7 million in back wages and compensatory damages, its share of employer taxes, and up to $250,000 in administration fees and will furnish other relief, including jobs, to settle a sex discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.

According to the EEOC's lawsuit, Walmart's London, Ky., Distribution Center denied jobs to female applicants from 1998 through February 2005. During that time period, the EEOC contends, Walmart regularly hired male entry-level applicants for warehouse positions, but excluded female applicants who were equally or better qualified. The EEOC alleged that Walmart regularly used gender stereotypes in filling entry-level order filler positions. Hiring officials told applicants that order filling positions were not suitable for women, and that they hired mainly 18- to 25-year-old males for order filling positions, the EEOC said.

Excluding women from employment or excluding them from certain positions because of gender violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

The consent decree settling the suit, entered by the court on March 1, 2010, requires Walmart to provide order filler jobs, as they become available, to eligible and interested female class members, as determined by a claims administrator. Walmart will fill the first 50 available order filler positions with female class members. For the next 50 positions, female class members will be offered every other job. Thereafter, every third position will be offered to female class members.

"Forty-plus years after the passage of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, far too many employers are still blatantly excluding women from particular jobs, segregating their workforces on the basis of sex, and denying women equal pay for equal work," said Acting EEOC Chairman Stuart J. Ishimaru. "Let this major settlement serve as a warning: Employers must stop engaging in these outdated and sexist practices, or they will face severe legal consequences."

Pursuant to the consent decree, Walmart has agreed not to discriminate against females in hiring for order filler positions and not to retaliate against applicants or employees who exercise their rights, complain about discrimination or assist in an investigation or discrimination-related proceeding. Walmart will post a notice of non-discrimination at its warehouse facilities in Kentucky, train its managers and employees involved in the hiring process at the London Distribution Center, and use validated interview questions for the order filler position. Walmart will also submit reports to EEOC detailing its compliance with the decree.

A settlement administrator will distribute the proceeds to eligible class members. Walmart has agreed to pay the first $250,000 of the administration costs.

Indianapolis EEOC Senior Trial Attorney Nancy Dean Edmonds said, "Although it took a long time, we are very pleased that women who want to work at the London Distribution Center will now be able to do so and those who were rejected will be compensated for their losses and offered jobs."

Louisville EEOC Senior Trial Attorney Aimee McFerren added, "It is satisfying to know that the EEOC's efforts will allow the women in eastern Kentucky affected by Walmart's discriminatory practices to better themselves and their families."

According to company information, Bentonville, Ark.-based Walmart serves customers and members more than 200 million times per week at more than 8,416 retail units under 53 different banners in 15 countries. With fiscal year 2009 sales of $401 billion, Walmart employs more than 2.1 million associates worldwide.

Class members will be contacted by the Settlement Administrator. Updated information on the settlement will be available on the EEOC v. Wal-Mart information line (317) 226-5485.

The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency's web site at www.eeoc.gov.

Wal-Mart Fires Lead Plaintiff In    Harassment  Suit, Says Lawyer

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. may have opened the door to yet more legal troubles when it fired the lead plaintiff in a sexual harassment lawsuit last week, along with the woman's husband, according to their lawyer. Cory Rosenbaum of New York's Rosenbaum Faria said he is preparing to file retaliation charges against the retailer over what he called a "bizarre" decision to fire his client and her husband just weeks after the sexual harassment suit was filed in the Southern District.

The plaintiff, Melissa Jackson, is one of several women suing Wal-Mart, alleging the retailer knowingly allowed an associate at a store in Monticello, N.Y., to work alongside them, despite their complaints that he had sexually harassed them. The suit was filed Jan. 22. On Feb. 16, after working the midnight shift, Ms. Jackson and her husband were fired, according to Mr. Rosenbaum. "I don't know why they would do that," said Mr. Rosenbaum, who called his clients model employees. "They've both been there for a decade, and within two weeks of filing a lawsuit they get fired. It doesn't make any sense. It's clearly retaliation."

Officials at Wal-Mart were not available for comment. Michael Hanan, a partner in the Princeton, N.J., office of Fox Rothschild, who represents the Monticello store, did not return calls for comment. And a response to the sexual harassment lawsuit has not been filed yet.

Mr. Rosenbaum also has an age discrimination lawsuit pending against the same Wal-Mart store. In that suit, filed Feb. 11 in the Southern District, a group of nine employees is suing Wal-Mart for $20 million, alleging the Monticello store routinely fires older, more experienced workers and replaces them with younger, less experienced employees. The latest suits follow a series of major settlements Wal-Mart has paid over the last year to resolve employment disputes. Most recently, Wal-Mart agreed in December to pay $40 million to resolve what may be the largest wage-and-hour class action settlement in Massachusetts history.

Walmart starts dumping big brands

In the recession, consumers have certainly become less discriminating with what they buy. The consumers want to spend their hard earned income wisely. Shoppers these days are buying less and looking for attractive bargains.

All major stores have started giving ultimatums to big brands to create value packs or they will start dumping their brands. Wal-Mart has already set an example by dumping Glad and Hefty-branded storage bags from shelves, replacing them with its own lower-priced Great Value brand.

In the case of Hefty, parent Pactiv Corp . the company claims that Wal-Mart has agreed to reverse the decision with a condition of making value packs for consumers. Wal-Mart and other sellers have decided to trim several name-brands across categories in coming months, or negotiate deals to get better pricing.

Consumer want cheaper pricing and Wal-Mart wants to live up to its reputation for providing low prices, and if it has to in that process dump a few big brands it won't mind at all. Variety becomes a burden in times when shoppers are not buying much and thus big brands need to quickly take steps to create value packs for their consumers or get ready to be thrown out.

10 former Wal-Mart employees file    discrimination  complaints

AVON, Colo. (AP) - Ten former Wal-Mart workers who are primarily Muslim and from West Africa have filed discrimination complaints against three stores in Western Colorado, saying managers treated them differently from other workers and denied them scheduled prayer breaks.

The workers, who filed the complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, said store management changed in January 2009, and the new managers suddenly started punishing and, eventually, firing them after years of working for Wal-Mart.

"All the sudden their work wasn't good enough," said Brendan Greene, an organizer for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition who has been coordinating the former employees' complaints.

A Wal-Mart spokesman denied the accusations of the complaints and said the company makes every effort to encourage diversity at their stores.

"The allegations just don't accurately reflect the working environment in these stores," Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Rossiter said.

The workers said previous managers had made an effort to accommodate for the workers' prayer breaks, turning an old break room into a prayer room. But after the change in management, Greene said, the room was locked and employees could no longer schedule their breaks to coincide with prayer times.

Didier Kane Barrault, a former night shift worker at a Wal-Mart in Avon, said a group of African employees at the store approached the manager about the treatment in late June. The manager agreed to meet with three workers, but refused to meet with the whole group.

Barrault said the manager's response was that the workers were free to leave if they did not like the treatment. Barrault said a wave of firings followed the meeting.

Greene met three employees of the Avon store last summer, then heard similar stories from employees at other stores. Greene said it shows a pattern of systemic problems with Wal-Mart management, and the 10 workers who have filed complaints are working on behalf of the whole community.

"When it was all said and done, in the Rifle, Glenwood and Avon Wal-Marts, more than 40 people have either been fired or resigned because of the pressure that has been applied to them," Greene said.

Rossiter said the Avon Wal-Mart store has continued to hire associates of West African descent, and three have been promoted to supervisory positions. Rossiter also said store managers have a portion of their bonus tied to diversity goals.

Ophelia Hinojosa was a night shift supervisor at the Avon store until she quit in April because she did not agree with the treatment of the workers. Barrault said two other supervisors quit for the same reason.

Hinojosa said the employees were hard workers but the new management cut hours and expected them to do more work.

"They cut down on the people, but expected everything to be 100 percent," Hinojosa said.

AVON, Colo. (AP) - Ten former Wal-Mart employees have filed discrimination complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against three Wal-Mart stores in western Colorado.

The workers are primarily from West Africa and many are Muslim. They claim the store managers treated them differently from non-African workers and that they denied them scheduled prayer breaks. The West African workers said that after years of work with the company, the managers suddenly fired them and said their work was not good enough.

A Wal-Mart spokesman denies the accusations and says the company makes every effort to encourage diversity at their stores.

Ex-employees accuse Wal-Mart Stores of    discrimination ; West African immigrants in U.S. say they were fired because of their race

A small group of West African men who came to the U.S. Rockies in search of economic opportunity are embroiled in a dispute with Wal-Mart Stores, accusing it of a raft of discriminatory actions. Most say they were dismissed because supervisors wanted to give their jobs to local people in need of work.

Wal-Mart, which has a history of discrimination and labor complaints but has increased efforts to promote diversity at its stores, rejects the accusations.

A Wal-Mart spokesman, Greg Rossiter, said that most of the men who had filed the complaints were part of a larger group of 90 employees of all different backgrounds dismissed last year after a management change at a store in Avon, Colorado.

‘‘These allegations just don’t accurately reflect the working environment at these stores,’’ Mr. Rossiter said. ‘‘We have a diverse group of associates, including many from West Africa, who are finding good career opportunities.’’

In complaints filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the 10 men said they had all worked for Wal-Mart for a few years, mostly without incident, at a variety of jobs at three stores in Avon, Glenwood Springs and Rifle.

But things changed in 2008 and 2009, when new managers took over the stores, according to the complaints, as well as interviews here with four of the men, who continue to gather weekly at a cramped apartment and talk of their hopes of getting new jobs.

In January 2009, six complainants said, a new manager at the Avon store called a meeting of workers — virtually all West African — and said: ‘‘I don’t like some of the faces I see here. There are people in Eagle County who need jobs.’’

Three other men, who worked at the Glenwood Springs store, said in the complaint that an assistant manager there, also new, had made a similar comment at a meeting of mostly West African workers.

One of them, Mamadou Sy, said in his complaint: ‘‘Directing himself towards the West Africans present, he said, ‘Wow, there are a lot of Africans, and I don’t like some of the faces I see here.’ We felt as if he was threatening us.’’

Most of the employees said they had been repeatedly disciplined for not meeting production requirements. Eventually, they were fired. Most of the workers had never been reprimanded before, and non-African workers were not subject to the same criticism, they said.

Mr. Sy, 61, said he had been fired in September after his supervisors told him he had to increase greatly the number of boxes he was stocking. He was not physically able to do so, he said.

‘‘I worked here for more than three years and never had any complaints about my job,’’ he said. ‘‘Now, we have all been getting fired. We felt it was racism.’’

Ophelia Hinojosa, a former assistant night manager at the Wal-Mart in Avon, said her supervisors had pressured her to discipline the men for not working fast enough, even though she believed they performed well.

‘‘They were trying to get most of the Africans out,’’ said Ms. Hinojosa, who quit in April because, she said, her job had become too stressful. ‘‘A lot of them had been there for a long time. They weren’t being treated right.’’

Idrissa Tall said that last summer, after nearly three years of employment, he was suddenly fired for not stocking shelves fast enough.

‘‘We saw a lot hard changes,’’ Mr. Tall said. ‘‘It hurt us; it shocked us. Everybody that got fired got fired for the same reason — because we are African.’’

Mr. Rossiter, the Wal-Mart spokesman, said that the West Africans had not been singled out for discipline and that many other workers at the Avon store had been laid off as well.

‘‘Since that time, the Avon store has continued to hire and promote West African associates,’’ he said. Three West Africans were promoted to supervisory positions last year, he said.

The employees who filed the complaints are seeking back pay. An employment commission spokesman, David Grinberg, said that U.S. law prohibited the commission from commenting and that it could take months to investigate a complaint.

Since the mid-1990s, the commission has filed about 60 employment-discrimination lawsuits against Wal-Mart.

Last year, the company agreed to pay $17.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that accused it of discriminating against blacks applying for jobs as truck drivers. And it faces the largest employment-discrimination class-action suit in American history, a sex-discrimination suit brought on behalf of more than 1.5 million women who are current or former employees.

But in the last six years, Wal-Mart has tried to recast its image — tying bonuses of corporate officers to minority hiring and mentoring, putting employees through diversity training and using suppliers owned by minorities and women.

‘‘We have an extraordinarily diverse base of customers and an extraordinarily diverse base of associates.’’ Mr. Rossiter said.

‘‘We understand and embrace that commitment.’’

Large Stock Focus: Microsoft Profit Not Enough Help

Better-than-expected earnings from Microsoft, Amazon.com and Mattel wasn't enough to halt the recent slump in the stock market.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 53.13 points, or 0.52%, to 10067.33 to end a difficult January, snapping a string of six straight monthly gains. The measure fell 1% for the week and 3.5% for the month.

Microsoft was the Dow's worst performer with a drop of 98 cents, or 3.4%, to $28.18, on Nasdaq. The stock's decline came despite a 60% jump in fiscal second-quarter profit. While the company has seen stabilization from its corporate customers, it doesn't expect its enterprise business to post growth soon.

Chevron dropped 1.12, or 1.5%, to 72.12. The oil giant's fourth-quarter profit plunged 37%, missing analysts' expectations due to a steep loss in its refining and marketing business.

Helping keep the Dow's declines in check, Wal-Mart Stores rose 82 cents, or 1.6%, to 53.43, after the big-box discount giant announced an alliance with global buying agent Li &Fung.

E-retailer Amazon.com reported a blockbuster quarter, expanding its share of U.S. retail during an otherwise flat holiday season for stores. Still, Amazon slipped 62 cents, or 0.5%, to 125.41, on Nasdaq.

Meanwhile, Mattel fell 32 cents, or 1.6%, to 19.72, despite a jump in sales of the iconic Barbie doll and a big improvement in overall profitability.

"Last year, good news was rewarded and bad news was largely shrugged off," said Haag Sherman, chief investment officer of Salient Partners. "A lot of investors had priced in a nice recovery, they priced in the fact that corporate earnings were going to be better than expected, and the market's become a lot more discriminating."

SanDisk (Nasdaq) fell 3.36, or 12%, to 25.42. The maker of flash-memory products swung to a fourth-quarter profit, helped by strong sales of its memory products. However, investors were disappointed with SanDisk's forecasts for first-quarter and full-year revenues.

Arch Coal fell 3.47, or 14%, to 21.07. With profit falling 98%, the nation's second-largest coal producer missed analysts' estimates for earnings and revenue.

PNC Financial Services climbed 1.29, or 2.4%, to 55.43 as Bank of New York Mellon is in discussions to acquire a unit of PNC that provides back-office processing for financial advisers, fund managers and brokers.

Microsoft Earnings Not Enough to Help Market

Better-than-expected profit from Microsoft, Amazon.com and Mattel wasn't enough to halt the recent slump in the stock market.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 53.13 points, or 0.52%, to 10067.33 to end a difficult January, snapping a string of six straight monthly gains. The measure fell 1% for the week and 3.5% for the month.

Microsoft was the Dow's worst performer with a drop of 98 cents, or 3.4%, to $28.18, on Nasdaq. The stock's decline came despite the software giant's 60% jump in fiscal second-quarter profit as the software giant benefited from deferred revenue tied to the latest version of its flagship product, the Windows 7 operating system. The earnings and revenue handily topped analysts' estimates. However, the company said while it has seen stabilization from its corporate customers, it doesn't expect its enterprise business to post growth anytime soon.

Chevron dropped 1.12, or 1.5%, to 72.12. The oil giant's fourth-quarter profit plunged 37%, missing analysts' expectations due to a steep loss in its refining and marketing business, a segment the company said will continue to be challenged by low demand for fuels. The stock's decline also came as crude-oil futures sank below $73 a barrel.

Helping keep the Dow's declines in check, Wal-Mart Stores rose 82 cents, or 1.6%, to 53.43, after the big-box discount giant announced an alliance with global buying agent Li & Fung. The buying agent, based in Hong Kong, is set to provide about $2 billion worth of goods to Wal-Mart in the deal's first year. The agreement will allow Wal-Mart to bypass numerous importers. Goldman Sachs upgraded its investment rating on Wal-Mart's stock to buy from neutral following the news. American depositary shares of Li & Fung, which isn't a Dow component, climbed 24 cents, or 5.4%, to 4.68.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 10.66, or 0.98%, to 1073.87. It slipped 3.7% over the course of January and dropped 1.64% on the week.

The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 31.65, or 1.45%, to 2147.35. For the month, it plunged 5.37%. It fell 2.63% for the week alone.

The declines came despite a bigger-than-expected rise in U.S. fourth-quarter gross domestic product and a slew of corporate earnings above analysts' estimates.

E-retailer Amazon.com reported a blockbuster quarter, expanding its share of U.S. retail during an otherwise flat holiday season for stores. Net income far exceeded analysts' expectations, gaining 71% in the fourth quarter, driven by a 42% increase in sales that stretched across media and electronics. Still, Amazon slipped 62 cents, or 0.5%, to 125.41, on Nasdaq.

Meanwhile, Mattel fell 32 cents, or 1.6%, to 19.72, despite a jump in sales of the iconic Barbie doll and a big improvement in overall profitability that helped the largest U.S. toy maker generate an 86% increase in fourth-quarter profit, topping analysts' estimates.

"Last year, good news was rewarded and bad news was largely shrugged off," said Haag Sherman, chief investment officer of Salient Partners. "A lot of investors had priced in a nice recovery, they priced in the fact that corporate earnings were going to be better than expected, and the market's become a lot more discriminating."

George Feiger, chief executive at Contango Capital Advisors, said another reason why stocks stopped moving higher is because investors are concerned that many of the problems that contributed to the recession are still prevalent. He noted "the household sector is struggling with a massive level of debt, and the commercial real estate market is still collapsing."

Mr. Feiger added, "there was this notion that we were going to have a recovery like the other recoveries. We've never had these levels of debt before, so it's not like you're going to repeat the patterns of the past."

SanDisk (Nasdaq) fell 3.36, or 12%, to 25.42. The maker of flash-memory products swung to a fourth-quarter profit on higher sales and margins, helped by strong sales of its memory products. However, investors were disappointed with SanDisk's forecasts for first-quarter and full-year revenues, although analysts' estimates for both figures fell into SanDisk's guidance ranges.

Arch Coal fell 3.47, or 14%, to 21.07. With profit falling 98%, the nation's second-largest coal producer missed analysts' estimates for earnings and revenue in the fourth quarter despite higher-than-expected volumes.

PNC Financial Services climbed 1.29, or 2.4%, to 55.43 as The Wall Street Journal reported Bank of New York Mellon is in final-stage discussions to acquire a unit of PNC for close to $2.5 billion, citing people familiar with the matter. The unit is PNC Global Investment Servicing, which provides back-office processing for financial advisers, fund managers and brokers. Bank of New York Mellon edged down 8 cents, or 0.3%, to 29.09.

Honeywell International fell 1.18, or 3%, to 38.64. The maker of aircraft engines and automation and transportation products posted a 1.3% drop in fourth-quarter earnings, in line with its October forecast. However, the results showed cost savings mitigated continued weakness in some of its primary markets as customers in the aerospace and building-equipment sectors continued to delay restocking thin inventories.

Warner Chilcott, a maker of branded prescription women's health-care and dermatology products, projected 2010 earnings well above Wall Street expectations. Its shares climbed 75 cents, or 2.8%, to 27.33 on Nasdaq.

Newell Rubbermaid dropped 63 cents, or 4.4%, to 13.57. The household-goods company reversed a prior-year loss in the fourth quarter as it continued to see demand stabilize and margins benefited from cost cutting and price increases. However, the company forecast full-year earnings below analysts' views.

Avery Dennison declined 5.59, or 15%, to 32.51. The office-supply company's fourth-quarter earnings rose 17% on prior-year charges, but the earnings fell short of analysts' expectations and the company forecast a wide range for 2010 earnings that disappointed investors.

Airgas fell 4.57, or 10%, to 42.26. The distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases posted a 25% drop in fiscal third-quarter profit, which prompted the company to lower its adjusted earnings target for the year and project fiscal fourth-quarter earnings below Street estimates.
