CHICAGO -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will double the money it spends with women-owned businesses, train women around the world and push major suppliers to use more women and minorities on work they do for the retailer, its latest steps to promote a brighter corporate image.

The moves unveiled by Chief Executive Mike Duke and others Wednesday come after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out women's massive class-action sex-discrimination lawsuit against the world's largest retailer in June.

That ruling was a major victory for Wal-Mart, which may still be hit with individual lawsuits from women. Now, the company aims to make a major mark on women's economic empowerment by setting five goals it hopes to meet by 2016. Wal-Mart, around the world, employs 2.1 million people, more than half of whom are women.

"This is not something that they're doing in response to anything else," said Alyse Nelson, the co-founder, president and CEO of Vital Voices, an organization that helps women in 127 countries with mentoring and training.

"It is the game changer, in my opinion. I've worked in this space for 16 years and I've never seen anything this big," Nelson said Wednesday as she headed to the Wal-Mart event in Bentonville, Ark.

One goal with the potential for major economic impact is to increase sourcing from women-owned businesses including construction firms, farms and manufacturers.

In the United States, Wal-Mart spent about $2.5 billion with women's businesses last year. It now plans to spend $5 billion annually by 2016 in the United States, and double sourcing from international suppliers run by women.

CEO Duke, speaking to a packed room at Wal-Mart's headquarters, noted that about 70% of the 1 billion people living in poverty around the world are women.

Also, less than 7% of venture capital goes to companies started by women.

Rally to launch new phase in Pittsburg worker's    discrimination  battle

Sept. 17--Pittsburg Walmart worker Betty Dukes, who lost class-action status for her 10-year-long gender-discrimination case against the retail giant before the U.S. Supreme Court, is trying to rally public support behind the next stage of her campaign.

After the June denial by the high court, Dukes' attorneys are shifting the case to California by filing another class-action suit here on behalf of Dukes and other class members in California, while doing the same for other class members in other states, said Dukes' Berkeley-based attorney Brad Seligman. Attorneys also plan to pursue individual cases nationwide.

Under the slogan "Our Fight is Not Over," Dukes is promoting a rally in her hometown of Pittsburg on Sept. 24 to mobilize backers for the new suits that allege a systematic bias against women seeking higher pay and promotions within the company.

"This is part of a strategy the lawyers put together after the Supreme Court ruling," Dukes said. "We're at ground zero again, with deposition and discovery again, being recertified from a federal to a state class action."

Her goal is to have a rally every 90 days to raise money and publicize the suits, with a final rally at a major site in Washington, D.C., such as the Lincoln Memorial, on the anniversary of the June 20 Supreme Court ruling.

The legal process in the California class action is expected to take at least two years.

"I have hundreds of emails of encouragement in regard

to this lawsuit," she said. "There's a huge base of support for the suit because the need is so great."

Dukes began her Walmart career as a part-time cashier with the Pittsburg store in 1994. Her case is based on allegations that men received training for jobs she wanted while she and other women were ignored.

There are five other named plaintiffs in the case, including Concord Sam's Club worker Chris Kwapnoski.

The class action is based on the premise that the policy was an institutionalized practice in hundreds of Walmart stores throughout the country.

Walmart has repeatedly denied any companywide discrimination against women in pay and promotions.

The Supreme Court unanimously agreed the plaintiffs' lawyers had improperly sued under a part of the class-action rules that was not primarily concerned with monetary claims, reversing a U.S. Court of Appeals decision.

On a second 5-4 decision, the high court justices also said there were too many women in too many jobs at Walmart to wrap into one lawsuit.

Discount giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has announced a multibillion-dollar initiative to promote female workers and women-owned businesses as part of an effort to improve its corporate image.

The move came as the largest retailer in the U.S. continues to deal with accusations that it doesn't have an equal workplace. The Bentonville, Ark., company may face individual claims of sex discrimination after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a class-action suit by female workers in June.

Wal-Mart said this week it has developed five goals, designed to "help empower women across its supply chain." Among them, the company said that in the next five years it will source $20 billion from womenowned businesses in the U.S. and double its sourcing from female suppliers internationally. It also will offer training, market access and career opportunities to 60,000 women.

UPDATE 3-No class action for now in Costco gender bias case

* 9th Circuit reverses class-action, cites Wal-Mart case

* Court leaves open possibility for recertification

* Women plaintiffs, Costco each claim victory

(Adds more background, more details from decision)

By Jonathan Stempel

Sept 16 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp won a court decision that blocks women who accused the company of gender bias from suing as a group, but the court left open the possibility that the case could regain class-action status.

The case involved about 600 current and former female Costco workers who said the largest U.S. warehouse club chain made it harder for them to be promoted to general manager or assistant general manager, in part because it failed to post job openings.

Citing a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of Wal-Mart Stores Inc , the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said a lower court judge applied the wrong legal standard, having failed to decide whether there was enough in common among the women's claims.

But the appeals court returned the case to U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel in San Francisco to decide whether she could still certify a class, and whether the plaintiffs can seek back pay and punitive damages.

In its June 20 ruling in Wal-Mart Stores Inc v. Dukes, a divided Supreme Court had thrown out a class-action lawsuit on behalf of as many 1.5 million female workers who claimed that retailer gave them lower pay and fewer promotions than men.

Writing for a unanimous three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit, Judge N. Randy Smith said that ruling requires Patel to now "determine whether there was significant proof that Costco operated under a general policy of discrimination."

Smith nonetheless rejected what he said seemed to be Costco's argument that the "rigorous analysis" required in the Wal-Mart case include an "in-depth" examination of the merits of the Costco plaintiffs' case. "To hold otherwise would turn class certification into a mini-trial," he wrote.

PLAINTIFFS, COSTCO SAY ARE PLEASED

Denying class-action status can result in higher costs and lower recoveries, and cause some plaintiffs with smaller or weaker claims to drop their cases altogether.

The Costco lawsuit began in 2004. Patel in 2007 granted class-action status for the three named plaintiffs and others. The case was put on hold pending the Wal-Mart ruling.

Jocelyn Larkin, executive director of The Impact Fund, which handled the case for the women plaintiffs, said "we are absolutely delighted" with the 9th Circuit decision.

"The district court had found that Costco had a common process for promotions, and statistical evidence that this adversely affected women -- sufficient for certification," she said. "Costco did not get the outcome it wanted, a finding that we would be unable under any circumstances to get the class certified."

Joel Benoliel, Costco's chief legal officer, said: "We are extremely gratified that our major points in the case have been vindicated, and it's clear the court has shut the door on a nationwide class. We will continue to defend this case."

Costco is based in Issaquah, Washington.

Smith was appointed to the 9th Circuit by President George W. Bush. He was joined in his opinion by Judge Richard Clifton, who was also appointed by Bush, and Judge Ronald Gould, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton.

The case is Ellis et al v. Costco Wholesale Corp, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 07-15838.

In the United States, Wal-Mart spent about US$2.5-billion with women's businesses last year. It now plans to spend US$5-billion annually by 2016 in the United States, and double sourcing from international suppliers run by women.

CEO Mr. Duke, speaking to a packed room at Wal-Mart's headquarters, noted that about 70% of the one billion people living in poverty around the world are women. Also, less than 7% of venture capital goes to companies started by women.

The presentation was also broadcast over the Internet.

The U.S. State Department, among others, is backing its new women's initiatives.

"I don't know of any other company that's making that kind of commitment and my hope is that it encourages others to step up," said Nell Merlino, founder and president of Count Me In for Women's Economic Independence, a non-profit that helps women grow their small businesses that has collaborated with Wal-Mart since 2008.

Wal-Mart also plans to help train and educate 400,000 women, including 200,000 U.S. women from low-income homes, in job and financialrelated skills. The company is funding its plans with US$100-million in grants from the Walmart Foundation and its international businesses.

Wal-Mart often comes under fire with groups claiming, among other issues, that its stores put smaller shops out of business and that it does not pay its workers enough. Its attempts to open stores in certain locations, most notably New York City, have been met with opposition from community groups.

The company has been working to promote a more caring image through various initiatives, such as working with U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama to expand access to healthy food and pushing companies to sell more environmentally friendly products.

Some of the efforts are building on work that Wal-Mart has already done. In 2005, it pushed law firms to increase the gender and ethnic diversity among the staff that did business with the retailer. Now it is asking other firms, such as advertising agencies and suppliers who sell more than US$1-billion of products to the chain each year, to do the same.

Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, is launching measures that it says will help women around the world over the next five years.

The retailer said it will spend 20 billion (Bt605.3 billion) over that period on goods and services from US businesses owned by women. It also plans to double the amount it pays women-run suppliers overseas, though it didn't give a total.

The discount giant also aims to offer training to sharpen the skills of 60,000 women working in factories that supply products to Wal-Mart and other merchants. And it plans to teach life skills , from punctuality to financial literacy , to 200,000 women overseas and to 200,000 low-income women in the US

Wal-Mart also said it plans to work with its suppliers that have more than 1 billion in sales to increase the representation of women and members of minority groups by the end of 2016.

"We know this is important for our customers, and it will make for a stronger business," Leslie Dach, executive vice president of Wal-Mart, said during an interview with The Associated Press.

He noted that over the past year that the company had developed the plan with help from a number of government and non-governmental organisations and philanthropic groups including Care USA, a humanitarian organisation that fights poverty.

Wal-Mart has placed an increasing focus on serving women. In 2009, it set up a women's council made of 20 female company leaders worldwide who offer guidance on everything from training and development to promotions.

In 2004, a sex-bias lawsuit against Wal-Mart was given class action status on behalf of 1.6 million women. In June, the retailer scored a major victory when the US Supreme Court blocked the lawsuit, saying there was not convincing proof of company-wide pay or promotion discrimination at Wal-Mart.

With Wal-Mart generating 418 billion in revenue last year and operating in more than 80 countries, the company's initiatives carry some clout.

"This is a game changer," said Helen Gayle, president and CEO of Care USA. "This is a large initiative. If Wal-Mart begins to change the way it does its practices, it can have a huge impact on other corporations and other retailers."

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will double the money it spends with women-owned businesses, train women around the world and push major suppliers to use more women and minorities on work they do for the retailer, its latest steps to promote a brighter corporate image.

The moves unveiled by chief executive Mike Duke and others Wednesday come after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a massive classaction sex-discrimination lawsuit against the world's largest retailer in June.

That ruling was a major victory for Wal-Mart, which may still be hit with individual lawsuits from the women involved. Now, the company aims to make a major mark on women's economic empowerment by setting five goals it hopes to meet by 2016. Wal-Mart, around the world, employs 2.1 million people, more than half of whom are women.

"This is not something that they're doing in response to anything else," said Alyse Nelson, the co-founder, president and CEO of Vital Voices, an organization that helps women in 127 countries with mentoring and training.

"It is the game changer, in my opinion. I've worked in this space for 16 years and I've never seen anything this big," Nelson said Wednesday as she headed to the Wal-Mart event in Bentonville, Arkansas.

One goal with the potential for major economic impact is to increase sourcing from women-owned businesses including construction firms, farms and manufacturers.

In the United States, Wal-Mart spent about $2.5 billion U.S. with women's businesses last year. It now plans to spend $5 billion annually by 2016 in the United States, and double sourcing from international suppliers run by women.

CEO Duke, speaking to a packed room at Wal-Mart's headquarters, noted that about 70 per cent of the one billion people living in poverty around the world are women. Also, less than seven per cent of venture capital goes to companies started by women.

Wal-Mart unveils women's initiative in wake of bias case

Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, on Wednesday unveiled a multibillion-dollar women's initiative, three months after winning dismissal of a gender-bias case from the U.S. Supreme Court.

The plan includes buying $20 billion of products from U.S. femaleowned businesses in the next five years and training women to work in factories and retail around the globe. The world's largest private employer will also provide more than $100 million in grants to non-profit organizations aiding women.

Wal-Mart will ask some companies such as ad agencies it works with to hire and promote more women, said Deisha Galberth, a spokeswoman. The move mirrors programs the retailer had previously announced, including efforts to buy more food from farmers located near its stores.

"We're stepping up our efforts to help educate, source from and open markets for women around the world," chief executive Mike Duke said in a statement.

The U.S. Supreme Court in June rejected an effort on behalf of as many as one million female workers to sue Wal-Mart for discrimination.

Filed in 2001, the suit aimed to cover every woman who worked at the retailer's Walmart and Sam's Club's stores at any point since December 1998, including those not hired until years after the suit was filed.

Wal-Mart may still face smaller gender discrimination lawsuits in lower courts and claims with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

"The Wal-Mart public-relations machine is spinning overtime on this," said Brian Sozzi, an analyst at Wall Street Strategies in New York. "They are doing their best job to try and get out in front of any potential future lawsuits."

Wal-Mart programs focused on women

Wal-Mart planned to announce new programs Wednesday aimed at helping female workers and businesses owned by women, as the company continues to deal with the possibility of individual claims of sex discrimination after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a class-action suit by female workers this summer.

In an advance draft of the announcement, Wal-Mart said it planned to buy a total of $20 billion worth of products from businesses owned by women in the United States over the next five years, which works out to an average of $4 billion a year, versus the $2.5 billion a year it now spends, and to double what it buys from businesses owned by women globally by 2016.

The company said it would also support the training of women in factories and farms that are Wal-Mart suppliers, donate $100 million to causes supporting women’s economic development and ask its vendors and ad agencies or public relations firms to increase representation of women and minority groups on their Wal-Mart accounts.

‘‘If you look at retail, the vast majority of our customers are women, and if you look at Wal-Mart, the majority of our associates are women,’’ Leslie A. Dach, the executive vice president of corporate affairs for Wal-Mart, said in an interview. ‘‘It makes complete sense for us to really have a focus on how we have the best associates we can, how we help women suppliers succeed and how we engage our communities.’’

The $5 billion a year that Wal-Mart plans to spend with businesses owned by women would still be a small percentage of Wal-Mart’s overall budget. The $4 billion a year, on average, that Wal-Mart will spend on goods from such businesses in the United States works out to about 5 percent of the company’s annual operating expenses.

‘‘Over the course of the five years, we are going to both have to seek out the businesses that are there and open ourselves up to that, and also we’re going to help these businesses grow,’’ Mr. Dach said. ‘‘They’ll range from construction to farming to food, and one of the great things about this is, we will also improve the assortment of products we sell to people and help our products become more relevant.’’

Mr. Dach said the announcement Wednesday was not a reaction to the class-action suit against Wal-Mart, which charged unfair treatment of women in the workplace; the U.S. Supreme Court recently threw out the case. Some of the plaintiffs have said they will still try to sue the company through individual claims.

But some critics were quick to find fault with Wal-Mart’s plans. Janet Shenk, a former A.F.L.-C.I.O. official, said Wal-Mart’s plan to buy more products from women was a way of not dealing with problems.

‘‘Once again, Wal-Mart is avoiding every issue that touches on how its products are produced,’’ said Ms. Shenk, who oversees some corporate grants at the Panta Rhea Foundation, which works to combat corporate influence. ‘‘It’s not about who owns the factory. So far as I know, there’s no evidence that factories and businesses owned by women treat their employees better or have better conditions than factories and businesses owned by men.’’

Yet CARE, a nonprofit development and relief agency, said Wal-Mart support would help advance its work.

‘‘The typical woman we work with is a woman working in an apparel factory in, say, Bangladesh,’’ said Melanie Minzes, senior director for development at CARE. ‘‘She is probably illiterate, probably gets sick pretty easily because she doesn’t have much health education. With Wal-Mart’s commitment, we are going to be able to reach tens of thousands of women like her and improve their lives and economic positions. We will be able to teach them to read, how to address common abuses they face and what proper nutrition is — all things that will make her a better, healthier employee.’’

Wal-Mart has measured the gender and ethnic diversity at law firms that work for it since 2005. In the draft of the Wednesday announcement, it did not specify what its new standards might be. Asked why there were no specifications, Mr. Dach said, ‘‘It’s important for us to be realistic about that as we make change — we’re not asking anyone to turn over their work force, but we’re confident that it will help us get results like it did in the legal field.’’

According to the draft, the announcement will be similar to those made by Wal-Mart in the past several years outlining goals on locally sourced agriculture, addressing ‘‘food deserts’’ in urban areas and reducing energy use.

Wal-Mart (WMT) Plans Massive Multi-billion Spending Initiative to Support Women in Workforce

Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) is now all-about empowering women.

According to reports, the nation's, and globe's, largest retailer will set aside billions over the next five-years to train and promote female workers, as well as support female-owned businesses.

Part of the commitment, according to the WaPo, is $100 million in grants for nonprofits to teach females with low-income some new job skills, as well as train those that work in overseas farms and factories that supply Wal-Mart with goods.

Wal-Mart also committed to spending $20 billion over the next five-years to support female-owned businesses, about double its current commitment.

Half of Wal-Mart's 200 million weekly shoppers are female, according to its Head of Corporate Affairs, Leslie Dach. Additionally, more than half of its 2 million workers are female.

The move may in to counteract recent claims that Wal-Mart practices sexual discrimination, an allegation that the Supreme Court blocked from becoming a class-action lawsuit over the summer. Former Wal-Mart employees will seek to challenge Wal-Mart individually, potentially a frivolous undertaking.

Wal-Mart said plans for the initiative have been in the works for about a year.

Shares of Wal-Mart are slightly higher Wednesday, ahead of the bell.

Wal-Mart pledges billions to aid women businesses; Wal-Mart is slated to announce Wednesday that it will spend billions of dollars over the next five years to train female workers around the world and support women-owned businesses.

Wal-Mart is slated to announce Wednesday that it will spend billions of dollars over the next five years to train female workers around the world and support women-owned businesses, the latest attempt by the world's largest retailer to tackle broad social issues and shore up its image.

The commitment includes $100million in grants to non­profit groups focused on developing job skills for low-income women in the United States and for women who work in the overseas farms and factories that Wal-Mart relies on for its merchandise. It also said it will spend $20billion over the next five years to buy goods from the nation's women-owned businesses, double its current amount.

"We have looked kind of systematically in the places our business can make a difference, that will make us a stronger business and will also help our customers and our communities," said Leslie Dach, head of corporate affairs at Wal-Mart. "This is clearly right there in that sweet spot."

Most of the 200million customers who shop at Wal-Mart each week are female, and like at many retailers, executives refer to shoppers in their stores as "she." More than half of its 2million employees are women, and Dach said that the initiative will help the company recruit and attract better workers.

Wal-Mart has been criticized for its treatment of women. For years, it was embroiled in a massive sex-discrimination lawsuitthat alleged that the company paid women less than their male counterparts and passed them over for promotions. This summer, the Supreme Court blocked the case from receiving class-action status, and attorneys for the women involved said they plan to file individual complaints.

Dach said that Wednesday's initiative has been in the works for about a year and is not related to the suit.

The company has launched similar sweeping programs in recent years centered on issues for which it had been vilified. It tempered complaints that its big-box stores and penny-pinching prices helped drive suburban sprawl and pollution from its overseas suppliers with ambitious promises to recycle and reduce its carbon footprint.

Wal-Mart scored a major coup early this year when it teamed up with first lady Michelle Obama on a program to reduce sodium and sugar in the food it sells — and followed up a few months later with a plan to open hundreds of stores in urban areas,where labor unions and other groups have long opposed its entry.

For the women's initiative, Wal-Mart worked with Melanne Verveer, U.S. ambassador-at-large for global women's issues and former chief of staff for Hillary Rodham Clinton when she was first lady. Verveer is slated to speak Friday at a breakfast sponsored by Wal-Mart at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in San Francisco. In a statement, she called the retailer's move a "bold step forward."

"Together, we will see these women change the lives of their families and communities for the better," she said.

The program will also require suppliers with more than $1billion in sales to increase the percentage of women and minorities on their Wal-Mart accounts. In addition, it vowed to double its purchases from female suppliers internationally.

Helene Gayle, chief executive of the humanitarian group CARE USA, said her organization began working with Wal-Mart in 2009 on a program for women working in garment factories in Bangladesh and cashew farms in India for the retailers' suppliers. Gayle said working with Wal-Mart was appealing because its mammoth size means it has an outsized impact.

"As such a huge industry leader, what they do hopefully will help to shape what others do in the field," she said.

Wal-Mart aims for change with multibillion-dollar initiative to help women

Wal-Mart announced Wednesday that it will spend $20 billion on goods and services from US businesses owned by women. Other expenditures and projects are in the works as well.

Will it work?

Wal-Mart is appears to be hoping that a new multibillion-dollar initiative will not only help women, but will also aid in changing its image.

Three months ago, Wal-Mart achieved a major legal victory - but incurred public-relations problems - when the US Supreme Court threw out an employee class-action lawsuit against it. Some 1.5 million women were suing for pay and promotion. It was the largest gender- discrimination class-action lawsuit in history.

"The Supreme Court decision in the Wal-Mart sex-discrimination class action has received an incredible amount of media attention, much of it negative and critical of the court's decision in favor of Wal-Mart," says Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California, Davis School of Law. Mr. Johnson made his comments in an e-mail.

Now, on Wednesday, the world's largest retailer announced it will spend $20 billion over the next five years on goods and services from US businesses owned by women. It also said it would double what it pays women-run suppliers overseas. In addition, the Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer said it will offer training to 60,000 factory women who supply its stores. And it will teach life skills - including punctuality and financial literacy - to 400,000 women worldwide (200,000 in the United States).

The initiative isn't merely public relations or window dressing, say a number of marketing experts and academics.

"This is not just manipulative marketing.... If it was just that, they would have lots of less-expensive options that would produce more short-term results," says Ginamarie Scott Ligon, an assistant psychology professor and assistant director of graduate programs in Human Resource Development at Villanova University. "Companies who use community outreach like this are adopting a much more expensive and long-term approach."

Wal-Mart says it developed its plan over the past year with input from government and nongovernment groups including CARE USA, a humanitarian group that fights poverty.

Some say that Wal-Mart's initiative is likely to influence other large corporations to do socially conscious things as well.

"Just because this will expand their customer base and they have long needed to improve their image doesn't make it anything less than visionary and great leadership," says Richard Levick, president and CEO of Levick Strategic Communications, a global marketing firm based in Washington. "It will encourage other companies to follow."

Mr. Levick notes that he himself is on contract with Wal-Mart's competitors, but nonetheless, he says he admires what the retailer has done globally to improve the quality of life - from encouraging far lower generic drug prices to standardizing energy-efficient light bulbs to influencing microfinancing.

"They are so big that they are often a target ... but they are doing all the right things and should be applauded for taking these kinds of socially responsible initiatives," he says.

Indeed, Wal-Mart has often been a target, long before the class- action lawsuit. Many a community campaign has tried to keep the retailer away because of concerns it will undercut local businesses and cause traffic and pollution problems. There have been numerous complaints that Wal-Mart squeezes costs so much that entire industries are negatively affected, notes Michael Smith, an associate professor of communications at La Salle University in Philadelphia.

Still, Wal-Mart officials say that the new initiative is not in response to the lawsuit or other criticisms.

"For us, this is about stepping up in an area we know we can make a difference in," said Sarah Thorn, senior director for international trade at Wal-Mart, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

In recent years, Wal-Mart has worked on other socially conscious initiatives. In May 2010, for example, it announced a $2 billion effort to help fight hunger in America.

Whether the new initiative truly helps women, says Professor Smith, will probably turn on how specific projects are identified and how much local input is gathered as the projects are developed.

"Because of its size and prior reputation, Wal-Mart probably won't be able to satisfy everyone critical of the company and its practices," he writes in an e-mail. "However, this initiative seems to fulfill the dual purposes of community investment, helping both the company and community to prosper."

In many of the regions where the program will be developed, particularly in agricultural areas, women form the backbone of the economy, Smith says.

He writes, "By improving the lot and capability of women, the company is improving the community as a whole."

* Wal-Mart to double spending with women-owned businesses

* More than 50 percent of Wal-Mart employees are women

* Shares up 38 cents to $51.97

(Adds CEO, participating group comments; stock activity)

By Jessica Wohl

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc will double the money it spends with women-owned businesses, train women around the world and push major suppliers to use more women and minorities on work they do for the retailer, its latest steps to promote a brighter corporate image.

The moves unveiled by Chief Executive Mike Duke and others Wednesday come after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out women's massive class-action sex-discrimination lawsuit against the world's largest retailer in June.

That ruling was a major victory for Wal-Mart, which may still be hit with individual lawsuits from women. Now, the company aims to make a major mark on women's economic empowerment by setting five goals it hopes to meet by 2016. Wal-Mart, around the world, employs 2.1 million people, more than half of whom are women.

"This is not something that they're doing in response to anything else," said Alyse Nelson, the co-founder, president and CEO of Vital Voices, an organization that helps women in 127 countries with mentoring and training.

"It is the game changer, in my opinion. I've worked in this space for 16 years and I've never seen anything this big," Nelson said Wednesday as she headed to the Wal-Mart event in Bentonville, Arkansas.

One goal with the potential for major economic impact is to increase sourcing from women-owned businesses including construction firms, farms and manufacturers.

In the United States, Wal-Mart spent about $2.5 billion with women's businesses last year. It now plans to spend $5 billion annually by 2016 in the United States, and double sourcing from international suppliers run by women.

CEO Duke, speaking to a packed room at Wal-Mart's headquarters, noted that about 70 percent of the 1 billion people living in poverty around the world are women. Also, less than 7 percent of venture capital goes to companies started by women.

The presentation was also broadcast over the Internet.

The U.S. State Department, among others, is backing its new women's initiatives.

"I don't know of any other company that's making that kind of commitment and my hope is that it encourages others to step up," said Nell Merlino, founder and president of Count Me In for Women's Economic Independence, a nonprofit that helps women grow their small businesses that has collaborated with Wal-Mart since 2008.

Wal-Mart also plans to help train and educate 400,000 women, including 200,000 U.S. women from low-income homes, in job and financial-related skills. The company is funding its plans with $100 million in grants from the Walmart Foundation and its international businesses.

Wal-Mart often comes under fire with groups claiming, among other issues, that its stores put smaller shops out of business and that it does not pay its workers enough. Its attempts to open stores in certain locations, most notably New York City, have been met with opposition from community groups.

The company has been working to promote a more caring image through various initiatives, such as working with U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama to expand access to healthy food and pushing companies to sell more environmentally friendly products.

Some of the efforts are building on work that Wal-Mart has already done. In 2005, it pushed law firms to increase the gender and ethnic diversity among the staff that did business for the retailer. Now it is asking other firms, such as advertising agencies and suppliers who sell more than $1 billion of products to the chain each year, to do the same.

US: Wal-Mart launches initiatives to support women.

Wal-Mart plans to double the money it spends with women-owned businesses, train women around the world and encourage suppliers to employ more women and minorities.

The world's largest retailer announced today (14 September) that it plans to spend US$20bn on goods and services run by women in the US and will double its sourcing from women-owned companies in "every market".

The company said that it will launch programmes to "empower" women on farms and in factories through training, market access and career opportunities. It has pledged to help 60.000 women working in factories to develop the skills they need to become "more active decision makers in their jobs and for their families".

It plans to help 200,000 women internationally through retail training programmes, in addition to helping some 200,000 women in the US gain the skills they need for employment and a career.

The company also plans to work with its service and merchandise suppliers to increase female and minority representation on Wal-Mart accounts. It has also pledged more than $100m in grants to drive progress against these goals.

The moves come three months after the retailer won a gender-bias case in the US Supreme Court. In June, the retailer won a case that ran for 10 years and included up to 1.6m women workers at thousands of Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores.

It may still face smaller gender discrimination law suits in lower courts and claims with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Wal-Mart To Boost Sourcing From Women-Run Suppliers

Facing potential gender-bias suits, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) plans to boost the amount of business it does with women-owned companies as well as encourage the training and hiring of women.

The Supreme Court in June rejected an effort to group as many as 1 million current and former women employees to sue as one class. The world's largest retailer could still face smaller discrimination suits, though the company said its new initiative is unrelated to that.

Shares rose 1.2% to 52.20 as most retailers and the general market rallied despite a weak retail sales report. Costco Wholesale (COST) climbed 1.5% and Target (TGT) advanced less than 1%.

Over the next five years, Wal-Mart plans to spend $20 billion in the U.S. on women-owned businesses, vs. $2.5 billion last year. It plans to double its sourcing from women-run suppliers internationally as well.

It aims to train and help educate hundreds of thousands of women, including retail training for 200,000 internationally and assistance developing job skills and accessing higher education for 200,000 low-income U.S. women.

Other programs are meant to train 60,000 working in factories and farms that supply Wal-Mart. It will also encourage major contractors to increase the number of women and minorities working on Wal-Mart accounts.

The gender-bias case was filed in 2001 and claimed, among other things, that women were under-represented in management positions despite more than half its worldwide workforce being women.

But the Supreme Court found that there was no evidence of a corporate policy that drove hiring and promotion practices at Wal-Mart's thousands of individual stores.

Wal-Mart to spend billions aiding women

Wal-Mart is slated to announce Wednesday that it will spend billions of dollars over the next five years to train female workers around the world and support women-owned businesses, the latest attempt by the world's largest retailer to tackle broad social issues and shore up its image.

The commitment includes $100 million in grants to nonprofits focused on developing job skills for low-income women in the United States and for women who work in the overseas farms and factories that Wal-Mart relies on for its merchandise. It also said it will spend $20 billion over the next five years to buy goods from the nation's women-owned businesses, double its current amount.

"We have looked kind of systematically in the places our business can make a difference, that will make us a stronger business and will also help our customers and our communities," said Leslie Dach, head of corporate affairs at Wal-Mart. "This is clearly right there in that sweet spot."

Most of the 200 million customers who shop at Wal-Mart each week are female, and like at many retailers, executives refer to shoppers in their stores as "she." More than half of its 2 million employees are women, and Dach said that the initiative will help the company recruit and attract better workers.

Wal-Mart has been criticized for its treatment of women. For years, it was embroiled in a massive sex discrimination lawsuit that alleged that the company paid women less than their male counterparts and passed them over for promotions. This summer, the Supreme Court blocked the case from receiving class-action status, and attorneys for the women involved said they plan to file individual complaints.

Dach said that Wednesday's initiative has been in the works for about a year and is not related to the suit.

The company has launched similar sweeping programs in recent years centered on issues for which it had been vilified. It tempered complaints that its big-box stores and penny-pinching prices helped drive suburban sprawl and pollution from its overseas suppliers with ambitious promises to recycle and reduce its carbon footprint.

Wal-Mart scored a major coup early this year when it teamed up with first lady Michelle Obama on a program to reduce sodium and sugar in the food it sells - and followed up a few months later with a plan to open hundreds of stores in urban areas, where labor unions and other groups have long opposed its entry.

For the women's initiative, Wal-Mart worked with Melanne Verveer, U.S. ambassador-at-large for global women's issues and former chief of staff for Hillary Rodham Clinton when she was first lady. She is slated to speak Friday at a breakfast sponsored by Wal-Mart at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in San Francisco. In a statement, Verveer called the retailer's move a "bold step forward."

"Together, we will see these women change the lives of their families and communities for the better," she said.

The program will also require suppliers with more than $1 billion in sales to increase the percentage of women and minorities on their Wal-Mart accounts. In addition, it vowed to double its purchases from female suppliers internationally.

Helene Gayle, chief executive of the humanitarian group CARE USA, said her organization began working with Wal-Mart in 2009 on a program for women working in garment factories in Bangladesh and cashew farms in India for the retailers' suppliers. Gayle said working with Wal-Mart was appealing because its mammoth size means it has an outsized impact.

"As such a huge industry leader, what they do hopefully will help to shape what others do in the field," she said.

Wal-Mart launches initiatives it says will help out women around the world

NEW YORK (AP) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, is launching measures Wednesday that it says will help out women around the world in the next five years.

The retailer said it will spend $20 billion over that period on goods and services from U.S. businesses owned by women. It also plans to double the amount it pays women-run suppliers overseas, though it didn't give a total.

The discounter also aims to offer training to sharpen the skills of 60,000 women working in factories that supply products to Wal-Mart and other merchants. And it plans to teach life skills -- from punctuality to financial literacy -- to 200,000 women overseas and to 200,000 low-income women in the U.S.

Wal-Mart also said it plans to work with its suppliers that have more than $1 billion in sales to increase the representation of women and members of minority groups by the end of 2016.

"We know this is important for our customers, and it will make for a stronger business," Leslie Dach, executive vice president of Wal-Mart, said during an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press. He noted that over the past year, the company developed the plan with help from a number of government and non-governmental organizations and philanthropic groups including Care USA, a humanitarian organization that fights poverty.

Dach couldn't quantify how many people the initiatives could affect, but he said they could reach more than 1 million.

Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark., has placed an increasing focus on serving women. In 2009, it set up a women's council made of 20 female company leaders worldwide who offer guidance everything from training and development to promotions.

In 2004, a sex-bias lawsuit against Wal-Mart was given class action status on behalf of 1.6 million women. In June, the retailer scored a major victory when the Supreme Court blocked the lawsuit, saying there was not convincing proof of companywide pay or promotion discrimination at Wal-Mart.

The moves to support women also come as Wal-Mart is aggressively expanding internationally. In June it completed a $2.4 billion acquisition of Massmart in South Africa.

It also is seeking to influence its core customers: Most of the 200 million people who shop every week at Wal-Mart globally are women, and they control $20 trillion in annual consumer spending.

With Wal-Mart generating $418 billion in revenue last year and operating in more than 80 countries, the company's initiatives carry some clout.

"This is a game changer," said Helen Gayle, president and CEO of Care USA. "This is a large initiative. If Wal-Mart begins to change the way it does its practices, it can have a huge impact on other corporations and other retailers."

Care USA started working with Wal-Mart in 2009 in Bangladesh, India and other areas. In India, Care USA helped cashew farmers increase their yield and taught them how to sell to Wal-Mart.

WSJ BLOG/Law: Trial Underway in Race-Bias Class Action against Iowa

By Nathan Koppel

It's rare that lawsuits make it to trial, particularly ones with as much on the line as the race-discrimination class action now being waged in state court in Iowa.

Trial began yesterday in the suit, which was filed in 2007 and claims that the state of Iowa has discriminated against blacks in its hiring and promotion of state employees.

The class consists of as many as 6,000 blacks in the state who have applied for jobs or promotions with the state. Court papers filed late last week by the plaintiffs contend that the case should be worth between $66 million and $71 million in paycheck damages alone, the Des Moines Register reports.

In a court brief filed last week, Thomas Newkirk, counsel for the plaintiffs, wrote that the case "isn't about costing the state money. It's about making the changes that help the state save money in the future when changes are made to the system to stop bias from adversely impacting any segment of the workforce."

Iowa has denied wrongdoing, and it also moved to dismiss the case partly on the grounds that the class was too disparate to satisfy the standards laid out by the Supreme Court in its recent ruling denying class certification in a discrimination case against Wal-Mart.

"Plaintiffs' claim challenges every hiring and employment decision ever made at every executive branch department for every job classification," the state contended in a court brief filed last week. Iowa state court judge Robert Blink declined to dismiss the case.

The Iowa Attorney General's Office declined to comment to the Law Blog.

In his opening argument yesterday, Newkirk claimed that testimony from state officials and a state-commissioned investigation will prove that Iowa failed to enforce state policies designed to prevent racial bias in hiring and promotions.

Deputy Iowa Attorney General Jeffrey Thompson declined to make an opening statement.

'Dukes' ruling kills class action against Wells Fargo

The U.S. Supreme Court's June ruling in Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes might not have turned out to be the class action silver bullet that some had anticipated, but that's little consolation to plaintiffs' lawyers who brought claims against Wells Fargo over allegedly discriminatory subprime lending. On Tuesday San Francisco federal Judge Maxine Chesney rejected the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, ruling that the proposed class of more than 1 million black and Hispanic homeowners didn't survive the certification standard for commonality set out by the Supreme Court.

Plaintiff lawyers at Bonnett, Fairbourn, Friedman & Balint and Roddy Klein & Ryan moved to certify the class way back in October 2010, citing the very decision that the Supreme Court overturned in June: a ruling by the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals affirming certification of the mammoth Dukes class. But following the high court's 5-4 reversal in June, Wells Fargo's lawyers at Reed Smith asserted that the plaintiffs' arguments for certification had been "discredited."

Wells Fargo's efforts paid off on Tuesday, when Chesney concluded that the proposed Wells Fargo class would be too unwieldy. "How the numerous potential differences among prospective borrowers, both as to their stated goals and needs as well as their individual circumstances, such as creditworthiness, may bear on the determinations made by the many loan officers and brokers across the country cannot, at least on the showing made here, be determined on a classwide basis," Judge Chesney wrote.

The Wells Fargo case isn't the only one that the Bonnet Fairbourn and Roddy Klein lawyers have brought against lenders alleging discriminatory loan practices, and Tuesday's decision isn't the first in which they've run up against Dukes. Last month the First Circuit remanded a case the lawyers brought against H&R Block's Option One Mortgage Corp. to a Boston federal district court to consider the applicability of the Supreme Court's case. (O'Melveny & Myers represents H&R Block.) Meanwhile lawyers at Goodwin Procter are pushing to apply the Wal-Mart decision in another putative class action against Bank of America Corp.'s Countrywide unit in federal district court in Louisville, Ky.

"Wal-Mart threw a monkey wrench into the works for class certification," said Gary Klein of Roddy Klein. (Who knows how the cases would have fared if not for Dukes: In April, the plaintiffs' lawyers secured a $14.75 million settlement with GreenPoint Mortgage Inc. in a similar case.)

In general, Klein said he has been making the case that the loan underwriting data he's relying on in the lending cases is stronger than the evidence of systematic discrimination presented in the Wal-Mart employment case. In the Wells Fargo case, the plaintiffs claimed that black and Hispanic homeowners were charged $560 million more than white borrowers with similar credit histories during the first five years of their mortgages. Despite that statistical evidence, Chesney cited the Wal-Mart decision Tuesday and ruled that the plaintiffs failed to show that Wells Fargo's loan officers used a "common mode of exercising discretion."

Klein said the plaintiffs were still reviewing the decision and had not decided whether to appeal. Wells Fargo counsel Tyree Jones Jr. of Reed Smith referred a request for comment to the company, which had no immediate comment.

The Practice
The future (if any) of class litigation after 'Wal-Mart'; Plaintiffs have three options in response to the Court's insistence that affirmative defenses receive individualized hearings.

Few doubt that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541 (2011), profoundly changed the litigation landscape. But most misunderstand why. The Court's rejection of a sprawling class action, which encompassed 1.5 million class members working in 3,500 stores across all 50 states, was hardly unexpected. The Court's new commonality standard, which requires plaintiffs to identify a common question whose answer can significantly resolve the litigation, will downsize class actions in size and scope, but this was already occurring in most circuits by virtue of the other requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) (e.g., typicality and adequacy of representation).

The real impact of Wal-Mart lies in its two other holdings: (1) that individualized money damages cannot be awarded in a Rule 23(b)(2) class action for injunctive or declaratory relief, and (2) that affirmative defenses in a class action require individualized hearings and cannot be resolved by a sampling procedure. These rulings could eclipse the significance of class litigation in many contexts and will certainly alter the tactics and incentives of the parties.

For plaintiffs, the most obvious adverse implication of Wal-Mart is that an employment discrimination class action seeking monetary damages will have to be certified in the future under Rule 23(b)(3). Bluntly put, that is generally impossible. The barrier is the "predominance" requirement of Rule 23(b)(3), which requires that the common issues of law and fact predominate over the individual issues. In employment discrimination cases, individual issues abound, involving differences in jobs, supervisors, employment history and the always subjective interaction between employer and employee.

So what will happen? Injunctive class actions can still be brought under Rule 23(b)(2) to challenge discriminatory rules or practices, and these will gain increased importance. But two problems arise with their new use: the first legal, and the second economic. First, if a class action is brought for injunctive relief and some plaintiffs seek to sue later in individual actions for compensatory damages, defendants will predictably claim that (1) plaintiffs are engaging in impermissible claim splitting by seeking to bring separate actions on the same operative facts; and (2) because Rule 23(b)(2) provides for a mandatory nonopt-out class action, plaintiffs cannot sue outside of the Rule 23(b)(2) class action. Indeed, some case law has even held that class counsel in a Rule 23(b)(2) injunctive class action cannot provide adequate representation to their class members because by bringing the injunctive action they cause the class members to forfeit their rights to seek monetary compensation. See In re Methyl Tertiary Prods. Liab. Litig., 209 F.R.D. 323, 338-340 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). If this is the law, the result is a true "Catch-22" dilemma, as neither injunctive nor compensatory relief would be feasible.

The second and more economic problem involves incentives and fee awards. Even if plaintiffs are successful in their injunctive action, no common fund is created out of which to pay attorney fees. Although Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 expressly authorizes fee shifting, the U.S. Supreme Court's modern decisions on fee shifting have greatly reduced the potential fee award by barring any risk multiplier and insisting on a modest lodestar. See Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council For Clean Air, 483 U.S. 711 (1987). The result is that not only will it be harder to obtain relief after Wal-Mart, but the economic incentives for class counsel will be reduced. Worse yet, this is unfortunately the setting in which defendants and class counsel may feel compelled to enter into settlement agreements that exchange weaker relief for enhanced fee awards. Similarly, settlement classes may be proposed that could never have been certified without defendants' agreement. Defendants tend to agree to such settlement classes only when the outcomes are favorable to their side.

But the even greater threat to the class action lies in Wal-Mart's insistence that defendants are entitled to individual hearings on their affirmative defenses. In the future, defendants may raise such defenses, less to win them than to convince the court not to certify the class because either (1) individual issues again predominate or (2) the class action is unmanageable. One cannot imagine the Wal-Mart class action going forward if the same jury had to hear all the affirmative defenses—real or imagined—that might exist with respect to its 1.5 million estimated class members.

Nonetheless, answers exist to the foregoing problems if courts are willing to respond imaginatively and exploit the discretion that Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 affords them. Let's begin with the claim-splitting or res judicata issue. At least three answers are possible: First, courts could certify parallel Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 23(b)(3) classes, each with its own class representatives and class counsel. See, e.g., Brown v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, 613 F.3d 44 (1st Cir. 2010). To be sure, the Rule 23(b)(3) class may not prove to be certifiable, but the Supreme Court has already permitted class members in Title VII cases to sue individually after class certification was denied. See Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 467 U.S. 867 (1984).

Second, courts could rule (and have ruled) that the due process clause trumps Rule 23 and permits class members to opt out from a Rule 23(b)(2) class, despite the rule's contrary language. See, e.g., Jefferson v. Ingersoll Int'l, 195 F.3d 804 (7th Cir. 1999). If class members opt out from the Rule 23(b)(2) injunctive class, they have not split their claim, even if others sue for injunctive relief. The problem with both options, however, is that most class members are apt to remain passive and not opt out.

Thus, the third and best route is for courts to recognize that, after Wal-Mart, no claim-splitting has occurred. According to § 24 of the Restatement 2d of Judgments, claim splitting occurs only when one fails in the first action to advance a legal argument that could have been advanced in that action. Because Wal-Mart denies individualized monetary damages in Rule 23(b)(2) classes, plaintiffs no longer have the option to bring such a claim in the first (or injunctive) action. Hence, the only way for defendants to argue that plaintiffs split their claim is by arguing that they were required to bring parallel Rule 23(b) (2) and Rule 23(b)(3) classes at the same time. That claim goes a bridge too far.

PLAINTIFFS' THREE OPTIONS

The greater challenge for class actions is Wal-Mart's rejection of sampling procedures and insistence that affirmative defenses receive individualized hearings. This will incentivize defendants to broadly assert affirmative defenses against individual class members. In response, plaintiffs have essentially three options.

First, they can challenge in many cases whether the affirmative defense has been pleaded with sufficient specificity to meet the "plausibility" standard of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007). Although there is little appellate law on this point, the first district court decisions have held that Twombly's higher standard applies also to affirmative defenses. See EEOC v. Kelley, Drye & Warren, 2011 U.S. Dist. Lexis 80667, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2011) (citing cases). This seems fair. After all, what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.

Second, plaintiffs could concede that there must be an individualized hearing, but argue that it should be before a magistrate or special master, and not a jury. To avoid the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial, plaintiffs should seek only equitable relief, rather than compensatory damages, Fortunately, back pay is considered equitable relief. See NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 48-49 (1937).

Finally, the last and most generally applicable answer would be to use issue certification under Rule 23(c)(4). In the class action, plaintiffs would seek to resolve only the general-liability issue (i.e., was there a general pattern of discrimination?), and then leave affirmative defenses and damages to individual actions (where there might again have to be a jury trial but only on the individual issues). The class action litigation would thus focus on the complex statistical issues that require expensive expert testimony, leaving the individual actions to focus largely on the employer's defenses. Such a procedure was recently used by the Florida Supreme Court with respect to tobacco claims. See Engle v. Liggett Group Inc., 945 So. 2d 1245 (Fla. 2006).

Recent decisions have divided as to how aggressively federal courts should use such "issue certification." Compare In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219 (2d Cir. 2006), with McLaughlin v. American Tobacco Co., 522 F.3d 215 (2d Cir. 2008). The test is that issue certification must significantly advance the resolution of the action.

Here, the dominant consideration should be that no other means exists by which the victims of employment discrimination (or many other forms of misconduct) can have their day in court. Wal-Mart need not be the last chapter in the story of how U.S. law deals with the problem of discrimination. But it could be—unless district courts are willing to adapt their procedures to a new challenge.

HASSETT'S OBJECTIONS - Supreme Court Roundup

As a threshold matter, my teenage son is wrong. Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n, Case No. 88-1448 (U.S. June 27, 2011), is not the most important case of this term to everyone, including insurers. That case recognized that minors have a First Amendment right to video games. While perhaps good news for liability insurers writing video game risks, most insurers are unaffected. As an aside, my son was frustrated to learn that the First Amendment applies only to the government and not to parents.

However, the Supreme Court issued several opinions of interest to the insurance industry. For example, it issued three decisions addressing class actions. While two were pro-business generally, they will have less impact on insurer class actions.

In Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, Case No. 10-277, slip op. (U.S. June 20, 2011), the Court rejected class certification in an employment discrimination claim under Title VII. In that case, the plaintiffs generally alleged female employees suffered discrimination in promotion and pay. The Court held a class could be certified only by "significant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination." Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes citing General Tel. Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157-158 (1982). Because Wal-Mart's general policy forbade sex discrimination, general evidence of stereotypical thinking could not provide the glue to hold together the class. While Title VII does recognize disparate impact claims, and Wal-Mart's policy of according significant local control to employment decisions could support a disparate impact claim, class certification was inappropriate.

While Wal-Mart's central holding would apply to employment discrimination cases within the insurance industry, as much as any other, it likely will be of limited application in the typical insurance class action where a plaintiff alleges a centralized business practice that damages a class.

However, a second holding in Wal-Mart may prove more valuable. The Court also held that individualized damage claims could not be wrapped into a class action under Federal Rule 23(b)(3)'s authorization of injunctive relief. The Court recognized but did not reach the question of whether monetary relief may be allowed at all under a Rule 23(b)(2) certification but squarely held that individualized claims may not be certified under that provision.

Additionally, the Court squarely rejected individual adjudication of monetary claims via a "Trial By Formula." Wal-Mart at 27. The lower court wanted to select a sample of plaintiffs and apply a statistical analysis of their claims to the entire class.

In a different decision, the Supreme Court unequivocally upheld class arbitration waivers in consumer contracts. AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, Case No. 09-893, slip op. (U.S. April 27, 2011). As we have seen in insurance cases, the plaintiff alleged in Concepcion that the class action waiver was unconscionable under state law.

While the Concepcion decision is of great value to business generally, it will have less applicability to the insurance industry. The basis of Concepcion is that the Federal Arbitration Act preempts contrary state law. However, many states have statutes barring or restricting, in whole or in part, the enforcement of arbitration clauses in insurance contracts. See Ga. Code Ann. § 9-9-2(c); Miss. Code Ann. § 83-11-109 (uninsured motorist coverage); Neb. Rev. St. § 25-2602.01; S.C. Code Ann. § 15-48-10; Ark. Code Ann. § 16-108-230; Nev. Rev. St. § 689B.067 (group health insurance). In other states, arbitration is formally or informally barred via regulation or regulatory reluctance to approve insurance forms with arbitration clauses. See United Ins. Co. of Am. v. Fla. Office of Ins. Regulation, 985 So. 2d 665 (Fla. App. 2008) (upholding insurance department's denial of application to include arbitration clause in life insurance contracts); Appleton Papers, Inc. v. Home Indemn. Co., 612 N.W. 2d 760 (Wis. App. 2000) (arbitration clause unenforceable where form not approved by commissioner of insurance).

The majority of decisions uphold insurance-specific restrictions on arbitrability based upon the McCarran-Ferguson Act which allows state law to control the insurance industry unless Congress expressly provides otherwise. See Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla. v. Inman, 436 F.3d. 490 (5th Cir. 2006); McKnight v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., 358 F.3d 854 (11th Cir. 2004). The result is that in those states that restrict arbitrability of insurance contracts, Concepcion will be of little help and may be harmful as a practical matter. As industries other than insurance continue to include class action waivers in their contract forms, the class action bar naturally will gravitate to targets in the insurance business.

The business community lost an important class action decision this term which addressed successive putative class actions. Smith v. Bayer Corp., Case No. 09-1205, slip op. (U.S. June 16, 2011). In Bayer, the defendant successfully had defeated class certification in a federal case. However, the class action bar then filed a similar action on behalf of a different putative plaintiff in state court. Bayer sought an injunction in federal court, which was granted notwithstanding the Federal Anti-Injunction Act. 28 U.S.C. § 2283. The Anti-Injunction Act bars federal courts from enjoining state actions, absent certain unusual circumstances such as when necessary to "protect or effectuate [the federal court's] judgments." Id. The federal district court concluded that an injunction was appropriate to protect the federal court's prior decision rejecting class certification, and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed.

The Supreme Court reversed, holding that a federal injunction is inappropriate where the named class plaintiff is different or where the test for certification under state law is different from that under federal law. The Supreme Court recognized the risk of successive litigation but noted that state courts and federal courts apply principles of comity and that the Class Action Fairness Act allows broader federal jurisdiction. Bayer at 11. Of course, the reality is that class action plaintiffs intentionally design their lawsuits to avoid removal under CAFA and some state courts' approach to class adjudications manifests the antithesis of comity.

Outside of the class action context, several Supreme Court decisions are of note to business generally, including the insurance industry. For example, in Federal Communications Comm'n v. AT&T, Inc., Case No. 09-1279, slip op. (U.S. March 1, 2011), the Court held that corporations do not have "personal privacy" interests cognizable under the Freedom of Information Act. Because the open records laws of many states are based upon FOIA, and the plaintiff's bar actively seeks information through open records requests, this decision may become important to insurers in the future.

In Sorrell v. IMS Health, Inc., Case No. 10-779, slip op. (U.S. June 23, 2011), the Court accorded some First Amendment protection to data mining as a marketing tool. In Sorrell, the Court struck Vermont's Prescription Confidentiality Law which protected pharmacy records revealing the prescribing practices of doctors. The Court held that the restrictions imposed a burden on protected expression.

We do not yet know the breadth of First American protection to be accorded to data mining. In Sorrell, the law at issue allowed data mining for other purposes, so the Court viewed the prohibition as content-based. It noted that a broader prohibition may have passed muster. Id. at 24-25.

* Discrimination claims had too little in common - judge

* Case brought for 1 million black, Hispanic borrowers

* Wal-Mart ruling made case harder - plaintiffs' lawyer

* Wells Fargo is largest U.S. mortgage lender

By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co won a court ruling denying class-action status to more than 1 million black and Hispanic borrowers in a lawsuit accusing it of discriminating on mortgage rates and fees.

Citing a recent landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of Wal-Mart Stores Inc , U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney in San Francisco said the Wells Fargo borrowers had too many differences to justify grouping them together in a single lawsuit against the largest U.S. mortgage lender.

The ruling on Tuesday could force borrowers to pursue their claims individually or in smaller groups, which could result in higher costs and lower recoveries, or cause some plaintiffs to drop their claims altogether.

In the case, six plaintiffs said Wells Fargo's "discretionary loan pricing procedures" allowed loan officers to impose higher rates, points and fees on minority borrowers than on white borrowers with similar credit profiles.

Citing an analysis by an outside expert, the plaintiffs said this practice had a disparate impact on black and Hispanic borrowers, and violated the federal Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act. They sought to certify a class of borrowers from 2001 to the present.

But Chesney said the plaintiffs failed to show there was any "common mode" by which loan officers exercised discretion to charge them more. She added that discretion "may have been exercised differently" in each borrower's case.

"Merely showing that a defendant's policy of discretion has produced an overall race-based disparity does not suffice" for certification as a class-action, the judge wrote.

In its June 20 ruling in Wal-Mart Stores Inc v. Dukes, a divided Supreme Court threw out a class-action lawsuit on behalf of as many as 1.5 million female workers who accused the retailer of giving them lower pay and fewer promotions than men. It said the claims would have too little in common, having arisen from millions of employment decisions in 3,400 stores.

Gary Klein, a lawyer for the Wells Fargo plaintiffs, said his firm is evaluating options for them. "Denial of class certification is going to make further prosecution of the case difficult," said Klein, a partner at Roddy Klein & Ryan in Boston. "Dukes certainly made our job much harder."

A Wells Fargo spokeswoman, Vickee Adams, said the bank is pleased with Chesney's "well-reasoned" decision.

Wells Fargo has faced other allegations it discriminates in home lending. Earlier this year, federal judges in Baltimore and Memphis, Tennessee rejected the bank's requests to dismiss lawsuits accusing it of steering black borrowers into home loans they could not afford, resulting in more foreclosures.

The cases are In re: Wells Fargo Residential Mortgage Lending Discrimination Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 08-md-01930; City of Memphis et al v. Wells Fargo Bank NA et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Tennessee, No. 09-02857; and Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Wells Fargo Bank NA et al, U.S. District Court, District of Maryland, No. 08-00062.

United States Supreme Court Rejects Gender Bias Class Action Against Wal-Mart: Lessons for Employers

Originally published in Mass Lawyers Weekly, July 2011

The United States Supreme Court, on June 20, 2011, issued another opinion in a line of long awaited employment decisions from this past term. In Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, the Court in a 5-4 decision rejected certification of a class of approximately 1.5 million current and former female employees alleging gender discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as punitive damages and back pay. 

Although these plaintiffs may not have represented the largest group seeking class certification, this is the largest number ever in an employment discrimination case, and the decision may have far-reaching implications to future class action cases.  The Supreme Court provides important clarification of the standards by which class actions are to be evaluated under Rules 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  In addition, the facts of this case and the majority decision and dissent give helpful guidance to employers about how to guard against allegations of discrimination.

The plaintiffs alleged that Wal-Mart's management decisions were unlawfully influenced by gender stereotypes and unconscious bias against women.  They argued that the corporate culture of Wal-Mart permits bias against women to infect the admittedly discretionary decision making of Wal-Mart's thousands of managers and that, consequently, all female employees of the company are victims of discrimination.  According to the plaintiffs, the company promoted and/or did not take steps to combat the impact of unconscious bias among managers who had broad discretion relating to employee compensation and promotions. 

The plaintiffs claimed that the alleged discrimination is common to all of Wal-Mart's female employees. The suit alleged that the local managers' discretion over pay and promotions was exercised disproportionately in favor of men, leading to an unlawful disparate impact on female employees.   

The District Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals certified the class made up of current and former female employees of Wal-Mart alleging that the company discriminated against them on the basis of their sex by denying them equal pay and promotions.  The differences among the allegations of the named plaintiffs, however, highlight the issue before the Court on class certification.

Betty Dukes began working in the Pittsburg, California Wal-Mart in 1994.  She started as a cashier and was later promoted to customer service manager.  She received a number of disciplinary warnings and was demoted back to cashier and then greeter.  Although she admitted violating company policy, she argued that the warnings were in retaliation for invoking internal complaint procedures and male employees were not disciplined for similar violations.  She also alleged that two male greeters in the same store were paid more than she.

Christine Kwapnoski worked at Sam's Club stores in Missouri and California.  She held a number of positions including a supervisory position.  She alleged that a male supervisor yelled at her frequently and screamed at female employees.  She claimed that the same manager told her to "doll up," wear some make-up and dress a little better.

Edith Arana worked at a Wal-Mart store in Duarte, California from 1995-2001.  Her allegation was that she approached a store manager more than once in 2000 asking about management training but was ignored.  She believed she was denied the opportunity to advance to a management position because of her gender and initiated a complaint pursuant to Wal-Mart's internal procedures.  She was told to appeal directly to the District Manager if she felt she was being treated unfairly, but did not do so.  She was terminated in 2001 for noncompliance with the company's timekeeping system.

The District Court found that women constitute 70 percent of Wal-Mart's hourly workforce but only 33 percent of management and, further, that the  higher the level of management, the fewer  women. The District Court also reported that the plaintiff's "largely uncontested descriptive statistics" showed that women were paid less than men in every region and that the salary gap widens over time for men and women hired for the same job at the same time.

The District Court also found that the discretionary decisions of managers with respect to pay and promotions were made in a "carefully constructed...corporate culture," including frequent meetings to reinforce common ways of thinking, regular transfers of managers among stores to create uniformity, and close and constant monitoring of stores.  Among the evidence presented was the fact that senior management at Wal-Mart often refer to female associates as "little Janie Qs."

Class certification is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. The plaintiff class must satisfy the requirements of both Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b).  Under Rule 23(a), the threshold burden on the party seeking certification is to show that: (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,"(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the

class, "(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and "(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class."

With respect to the second prong of Rule 23, the common question identified by the District Court in this case was whether Wal-Mart's pay and promotions policies gave rise to unlawful discrimination.  However, the Supreme Court in its majority decision emphasizes that the element of commonality in Rule 23(a)(2) requires a showing that the class members "have suffered the same injury" and that the common contention of the class members "must be of such a nature that it is capable of class wide resolution... in one stroke."  Justice Scalia, who authored the majority opinion, notes that alleged discrimination by one particular supervisor would satisfy this standard.

The Court reviewed substantial statistical evidence about pay and promotion disparities between men and women, anecdotal reports of discrimination from approximately 120 female employees, and testimony from an expert in sociology who conducted an analysis of Wal-Mart's culture and personnel practices.  The majority concluded that the plaintiffs presented insufficient evidence of commonality to meet the threshold burden under Rule 23(a)(2).  Justices Alito, Kennedy, Roberts and Thomas joined Justice Scalia in the majority opinion.

The dissenting opinion in this case, authored by Justice Ginsburg, criticizes the majority for focusing on the differences among the would-be class members, rather than their similarities.  The dissent stresses that Rule 23(a)(2) does not require that all questions of law and fact be common to all class members, but rather that a single question of law or fact among the plaintiffs will meet the threshold requirement of Rule 23(a)(2). 

The dissenting justices note that it is well established that the practice of delegating to supervisors substantial discretion in employment matters can result in disparate impact.  The dissent recognizes that "managers, like all humankind, may be prey to biases of which they are unaware.  The risk of discrimination is heightened when those managers are predominantly of one sex, and are steeped in a corporate culture that perpetrates gender stereotypes."

With respect to Rule 23(b), the Court concluded unanimously that the plaintiff's claims were not appropriately brought under Rule 23(b)(2) which provides class-wide injunctive or declaratory relief.  The Court found that the individualized circumstances of the plaintiffs and the back pay sought precluded application of Rule 23(b)(2).  The dissent would have had the case remanded for determination of whether the class qualified for certification under Rule 23(b)(3).  Concurring with respect to Rule 23(b) and dissenting with respect to Rule 23(a), along with Justice Ginsburg, were Justices Breyer, Kagan and Sotomayor.

With heightened awareness and training around the issue of discrimination, employers will increasingly find that discriminatory bias has gone below the surface and appears in less obvious and explicit ways than in the past, making it more difficult to detect and address.  Although the class in the Dukes case may have been too large and diverse for certification under Rule 23, smaller classes of workers making similar claims of a corporate culture unfavorable to women (or other protected workers) might more readily pass muster, especially if the class members work in the same state or region and have been subject to the same middle or upper level management. 

In-house and employment counsel should carefully assess current anti-discrimination policies, practices and training to see whether they adequately address not only obvious bias but also unconscious or implicit bias.  It is also important for employers to maintain accurate records for periodic review of the recruitment, retention, training and promotion of minorities and women.  Likewise, it is critical to keep data and conduct comparisons of compensation and performance appraisals.  

Claims of unconscious bias are on the rise, and statistical analysis will continue to be used as evidence in discrimination cases along with anecdotal information and expert testimony.  It is now more important than ever that employers maintain clear policies, increase anti-discrimination training, reduce discretion among decision-makers and regularly monitor workforce data.  With more information about the way in which employment related practices and decision-making are impacting women and minority workers, employers can identify and address potential problems and reduce the risk of litigation.

The protections include gender identity and gender expression Phillip Keene, a company spokesperson, told the Windy City Times. Keene did not confirm when the new policy went into effect, only that the change was made "several weeks ago."   

Sexual orientation protections are already a part of the company's "Discrimination and Harassment Prevention Policy."   

According to the news report, Wal-Mart scored relatively poorly on the Human Rights Campaign's annual Corporate Equality Index, which ranks major companies on their LGBT policies and practices. Wal-Mart received a 40% ranking out of 100 last year, for a failure to amend its anti-discrimination policy to include gender protections.   

Keene said the addition of gender protections in the policy was precipitated by a standard review of the policy and not by complaints.

On June 20, 2011, the Supreme Court put an end to what would have been the largest class-action lawsuit in U.S. history. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of more than 1.5 million current and former female Wal-Mart employees, alleged that Wal-Mart supervisors routinely discriminated against female workers by promoting and paying them less than their male counterparts.

That's too bad, because the facts presented by the plaintiffs describe a situation that surely calls out for redress.

Wal-Mart has a bare-bones policy telling managers how to dole out promotions. Eligible workers need only meet three basic criteria: 1) an above-average performance rating, 2) at least one year of job tenure, and 3) a willingness to relocate. Among these candidates, local supervisors have full discretion over whom to promote.

With the door wide open for supervisors to act on their subjective preferences, it may be no surprise that men dominate the company's management team. In 2001 women made up only 33% of Wal-Mart's managers, according to labor economist Richard Drogin, even though they made up 70% of its hourly workforce. Compare that with Wal-Mart's peer companies, where 57% of managers were women.

Wal-Mart also gives its (mostly male) managers significant wiggle room in setting their supervisees' wages. The result? Drogin reported that in 2001, Wal-Mart women earned consistently less than their male counterparts even after controlling for such factors as job performance and job tenure. He concluded that"... there are statistically significant disparities between men and women at Wal-Mart ... [and] these disparities ... can be explained only by gender discrimination."

The trouble is that these disparities exist even though no part of Wal-Mart's wage or promotion policy directs managers to make biased decisions. In fact, Wal-Mart has an anti-discrimination policy on its books.

With no "smoking gun" corporate policy, the Supreme Court blocked the women of Wal-Mart from lodging a collective complaint against the company. In the majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia writes: "Other than the bare existence of delegated discretion, respondents have identified no 'specific employment practice' ... Merely showing that Wal-Mart's policy of discretion has produced an overall sex-based disparity does not suffice."

In other words, the majority of Supreme Court justices intend to take a narrow view of which employment practices justify class-action discrimination lawsuits. Potential plaintiffs will have to show exactly how an employer discriminated. And as the Wal-Mart case demonstrates, this can boil down to the murky business of trying to expose employers' unspoken intentions.

What this means is that the traditional, complaint-driven approach to enforcing the 1964 Civil Rights Act cannot protect workers from discrimination. Deprived of class-action lawsuits as a tool, the women behind the Wal-Mart case and other workers in plainly discriminatory workplaces will now have to pursue their claims individually--at best putting them into a much weaker position with fewer resources.

To eliminate workplace discrimination and achieve true equality, policies have to focus squarely on the pattern of outcomes of employers' decisions. In a phrase, on the question of whether an employer discriminates," the proof is in the pudding." President Lyndon Johnson recognized this more than 40 years ago when his administration first put such policies into action under the rubric of affirmative action.

What does affirmative action require? First, the employer keeps a record of whether the race and gender make-up of its workforce is proportional to the wider pool of eligible workers. If not, the employer develops a plan to act "affirmatively"--with goals and timetables--to improve female and minority representation.

Affirmative action plans may include sexual harassment awareness training for supervisors, for instance, or directing recruitment efforts toward minority and women's organizations. Rigid quotas--the most controversial aspect of affirmative action policies--can only be used in the context of a court-ordered or-approved plan in response to a discrimination suit

The Wal-Mart case demonstrates why workers need affirmative action policies to eradicate discrimination. As President Johnson put it in 1965, affirmative action represents"... the next and more profound stage of the battle for civil rights. We seek ... not just equality as a right and a theory, but equality as a fact and as a result."

THE STORY OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT'S 2010–11 term can be gleaned from the decisions on its last day: high hurdles for injured persons seeking to hold companies accountable, vigorous protection for speech of most types, and the quick emergence of a freshman justice with analytical and writing chops.

Who would have imagined that the headline grabber five years after the Roberts Court's most divisive term—the one that began in 2006, which involved major race, abortion, and religion challenges—would be a case involving the federal rules for class action certification? Wal-Mart v. Dukes, of course, was not just any class action, but the largest discrimination class action in history, and therein lay the seeds of its ultimate rejection.

But the Wal-Mart decision also is emblematic of what has become a recurring theme in the Roberts Court, and one that sometimes crosses the now clear ideological divide on the Court. "The only real theme I picked up this term is the Court's basic and continuing skepticism about very large litigations," says veteran high court litigator Carter Phillips of Sidley Austin, who argued five cases this term.

But a second theme did dominate—one that, like the Court's "skepticism" or even hostility to big litigation, now seems identified with the Roberts Court. "This is the most consistently and strongly protective free speech Court in history," said Stanford Law School's Michael McConnell during a recent conference.

The Court ruled that First Amendment protection covers violent video games in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association, and hateful speech by protesters at military funerals in Snyder v. Phelps. In Arizona Free Enterprise v. Bennett they held that a state's matching-funds trigger in its public-financing system for elections violated the speech rights of nonparticipating candidates. And in Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., the majority struck down a state law prohibiting pharmacies from selling physicians' prescribing information to data-mining and drug companies.

Sorrell was a "rather aggressive" First Amendment decision, McConnell said, explaining that the Court found that the conveyance of information, even when the purpose is to make a profit, is protected speech.

The only exception to the First Amendment array, he said, was Nevada Commission on Ethics v. Carrigan, in which the justices unanimously upheld a state ethics law after finding that voting by legislators was not speech, but an exercise of power. Sorrell and Carrigan, he said, "show how important it is to get into that speech box" in order to prevail in this Court.

The term shed additional light on one question: What kind of role will the two newest justices play on the Court? Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan agreed with each other and with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg more often than with any other justice this term. Both are aggressive questioners during oral arguments but with noticeably different styles. Sotomayor asks questions in a careful, deliberate, and straightforward manner and rarely allows a lawyer to dance or weave in reply. Kagan brings to the bench the same sense of humor that marked her confirmation hearings last summer. Before reading a summary of her opinion in Smith v. Bayer, a case involving the relitigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, she warned the public audience that the decision would be appreciated by only those who had "a law degree and a strong cup of coffee" that morning. Her style of questioning is more informal, and she uses hypotheticals to a greater degree.

Sotomayor, a former prosecutor and trial judge, is making her voice heard in criminal cases. She wrote the majority opinion in J.D.B. v. North Carolina, ruling that a criminal suspect's age should be a factor in determining whether he or she is in custody for purposes of Miranda rights. What to her was a "common sense" approach to the Miranda issue was the beginning of the end of the one-size-fits-all, bright-line justification for Miranda, according to Justice Samuel Alito, Jr., also a former prosecutor, who led the dissenters.

But Sotomayor is not easily pigeonholed—even in this area of the law. Her ruling in Michigan v. Bryant that there was no confrontation clause violation in the admission into evidence of statements by a mortally wounded man to the police about who shot him and where it happened drew a near apoplectic dissent from Justice Antonin Scalia, who has led the revitalization of that clause in recent years. But, concurring in part, she joined him in Bullcoming v. New Mexico, finding a confrontation clause violation in the admission of a blood-alcohol report without in-court testimony by the analyst.

Many Court watchers expected Kagan's first term to be a relatively quiet one as she found her sea legs. Not so, says Heather Gerken of Yale Law School: The newest justice has "already made her presence known and shown every sign of becoming one of its intellectual leaders."

Kagan was assigned two particularly important dissents this term: Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn and Arizona Free Enterprise v. Bennett, considered her strongest of the term. In the former, a majority led by Kennedy held that taxpayers challenging a state tax credit for contributions to student tuition organizations that primarily fund religious schools had no standing to sue. And in the latter, the same majority, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, Jr., invalidated the matchingfunds trigger in Arizona's public financing system for state elections.

In the campaign finance case, Kagan, at the least, made Roberts work for his victory, Gerken says. "Justice Kagan went toe-to-toe with the chief justice—an experienced judge and one of the Court's finest lawyers—and didn't cede him an inch. Her prose was pointed and powerful. No argument made by the majority went unanswered."

Kagan, she adds, "managed to convey complex analytic points in a highly accessible fashion. All of this suggests that Justice Kagan is going to be an important presence on the Court. At the very least, she is on track to becoming as stylish and engaging a dissenter as Justice Scalia."

Despite charges by some that the Roberts Court is pro-business, the term was not a bed of roses in all respects for American companies [see charts, page 60]. Employees prevailed in a trio of retaliation cases: Staub v. Proctor Hospital, Kasten v. St. Gobain, and Thompson v. North American Stainless.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which participated in more cases this term than in any other, saw its views prevail in its three top cases: Wal-Mart, AEP v. Connecticut, and AT&T v. Concepcion (the Court upheld that company's ban on class action arbitrations).

But the Chamber did lose its own challenge to an Arizona immigration law in Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting. It was a federal preemption argument, an issue dear to the business community, particularly those businesses operating across state lines. And this term saw a "potentially enduring shift" in the Court's preemption analysis—the disappearance of the historic "presumption against preemption," according to Patricia Millett, head of the Supreme Court practice at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld.

Why do these cases matter, and not just to business? "We live in a world of broad congressional power, and preemption cases are the way federalism is worked out day to day," observes Neil Siegel of Duke Law School.

DALLAS, Aug. 18 -- The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued the following news release:

Wal-Mart Stores of Texas, LLC will pay $27,500 and furnish other relief to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.

The EEOC charged in its suit, Case No. 7:10-CV-118 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, that the company violated federal law when it subjected Paula Barstad, an overnight stocker at a Midland, Texas, Walmart, to sexual harassment. According to the EEOC, a male security guard sexually harassed Barstad, including unwanted verbal remarks and physical touching. Barstad reported the harassment to store management personnel on multiple occasions, but was repeatedly ignored. According to the agency's suit, even after Barstad submitted two written complaints about the harassment, management disregarded the reports and the sexual harassment continued.

"Sexual harassment by persons in security positions is particularly troubling given that such positions should promote a sense of safety not only to customers, but to the store employees as well," said Robert A. Canino, regional attorney for the EEOC's Dallas District Office. "When complaints are not met with an immediate response, an employee may be led to believe that a safe workplace is not a priority for management."

Sexual harassment violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed suit after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.

EEOC Trial Attorney Joel Clark said, "Title VII requires more than talking a good game about preventing harassment; it requires the employer's effort to take action once a complaint is made. Employers need to be proactive about eliminating sexual harassment as soon as they become aware of it. We are pleased that Wal-Mart decided to resolve this case early and without protracted litigation."

In addition to the monetary damages, the two-year consent decree resolving the case includes injunctive relief enjoining the Midland Walmart from engaging in sexual harassment and retaliation, and requires the store to post a notice about sexual harassment. The consent decree also requires the Midland Walmart to conduct anti-discrimination training for all managers, including overnight managers, about the consequences of violating federal anti-discrimination laws and failing to address reports of discrimination. The training will specifically explain the steps that managers and assistant managers should take when they receive a complaint relating to discrimination.

The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on its website at www.eeoc.gov.

Female Overnight Stocker at Midland Store Was Subjected to Repeated Sexual Harassment, Federal Agency Charged

The Practice
'Wal-Mart' notable for rulings on evidentiary issues; Court discounted the plaintiffs' expert testimony and anecdotal evidence—improperly, according to Justice Ginsburg.

Much of the commentary on the U.S. Supreme Court's blockbuster decision this past term in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes, No. 10–277 (June 20, 2011), has correctly focused on the Court's tightening of the threshold Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) commonality requirement for class certification. In requiring courts to pay attention to dissimilarities among class members, the Court announced a standard that will—paraphrasing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's words—disqualify many class actions at the starting gate. Slip op. at 1 (J. Ginsburg dissenting).

Although there can be little doubt that the court's pronouncements regarding the commonality requirement will have tremendous impact on class litigation, the Court additionally commented on some evidentiary issues that also may have significant import for future class actions. Consequently, the Court's observations on evidentiary issues in the Wal-Mart classcertification process are noteworthy, independent of the Court's pronouncements on the commonality requirement and the improper Rule 23(b)(2) class certification.

In the Wal-Mart litigation, the female employees alleging Title VII discrimination claims carried the burden of demonstrating that the proposed class action satisfied the threshold certification commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2). To show classwide discriminatory conduct, the plaintiffs offered the testimony of sociological expert William Bielby and two other experts: a statistician and a labor economist. Finally, the plaintiffs offered anecdotal evidence of discrimination through the affidavits of 120 female Wal-Mart employees.

In response, Wal-Mart moved to strike Bielby's testimony under Daubert standards for the admissibility of expert witness testimony, and counter-offered its own statistician in answer to the plaintiffs' experts. The district court concluded that Daubert standards did not apply to expert testimony at the certification stage of class proceedings, and declined Wal-Mart's motion to strike Bielby's testimony. See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993).

An unresolved question in federal class action jurisprudence concerns whether a court must hold an evidentiary hearing on the class-certification issue, and if so, what rules of evidence—if any—apply to the certification inquiry. Although Rule 23 is silent on these questions, many federal courts now require such evidentiary hearings, and do apply Fed. R. Evid. 702 and Daubert to evidence adduced in certification proceedings. Most federal courts have now moved well beyond the days in which they would certify a class action on the pleadings and allegations alone.

In its Wal-Mart decision, the Court did not resolve the question concerning what kind of hearing, if any, a trial court must conduct in order to certify a class. However, although the Court did not directly hold that Daubert standards apply to class certification, the majority signaled that the district court incorrectly refused to apply Daubert to assess the sociologist's expert testimony, instead admitting this testimony into the record and considering it in the certification decision.

The Court stated: "The District Court concluded that Daubert did not apply to expert testimony at the certification stage of class-action proceedings. We doubt this is so." Wal-Mart, slip op. at 14. Thus, if the question of whether courts must apply Daubert standards to expert witness testimony at class certification is ever directly presented to the Court, it seems likely that at least five justices would agree that this is a proper evidentiary rule for classcertification proceedings.

THE MERITS OF THE EXPERT TESTIMONY

In addition to suggesting that the expert sociological testimony should have been subjected to Daubert scrutiny, the Court chose to discount Bielby's opinions and conclusions that Wal-Mart has a strong corporate culture making it vulnerable to gender bias. The Court focused on the fact that Bielby could not determine, with any specificity, how regularly stereotypes played a meaningful role in Wal-Mart employment decisions. Because Bielby admittedly had no answer to that question—which was essential to the plaintiffs' theory of commonality—the Court held that Bielby's expert testimony was rightly disregarded in assessing whether the proposed class was united by a common question of fact or law. Wal-Mart, slip op. at 13-14.

The Court similarly discounted the plaintiffs' expert testimony of its statistician and labor economist, offered to demonstrate that Wal-Mart store supervisors engaged in a common mode of exercising local discretion that discriminated against female employees. The experts testified that, based on regression analyses that considered national and regional data, there were statistically significant disparities between the men and women at Wal-Mart stores that could only be explained by gender discrimination.

The Court's majority held that even if these studies and expert conclusions were taken at face value, they were insufficient to establish the plaintiffs' theory of discrimination on a classwide basis. This is because the plaintiffs failed to identify a specific employment practice tying their 1.5 million claims together. Thus, "[m]erely showing that Wal-Mart's policy of discretion has produced overall sexbased disparity does not suffice." Id. at 17.

The Court's repudiation of the statistical testimony cuts at the heart of such offers of proof based on regression analyses, often used by plaintiffs in classcertification proceedings to satisfy the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a) (2) and the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). In dissent, Ginsburg defended the experts' regression analyses, pointing out that the studies showed that there were gender-based disparities within Wal-Mart stores. She opined that the majority's contrary contention "reflects only an arcane disagreement about statistical method—which the District Court resolved in the plaintiffs' favor." Id. at 6 n. 5 (J. Ginsburg dissenting). Ginsburg further noted that appellate review was not an occasion to disturb a trial court's handling of factual disputes of this nature. Id.

THE ANECDOTA L EVIDENCE

In one of its more controversial rulings—strenuously objected to by Ginsburg—the majority further rejected the anecdotal evidence of employment discrimination offered by female Wal-Mart employees in 120 affidavits. Relying on Teamsters v. U.S., 431 U.S. 324 (1977), the Court indicated that a discrimination claim supported by anecdotal evidence must supply anecdotes in numbers proportionate to the class, which the plaintiffs failed to do. Thus, the Court concluded that not only had the plaintiffs failed to show that Wal-Mart's policy of discretion produced an overall sex-based disparity, but the plaintiffs' anecdotal evidence also was "too weak to raise any inference that all of Wal-Mart's individual, discretionary personnel decisions were discriminatory." Wal-Mart, slip op. at 17.

The Court criticized the fact that the 120 reported experiences of discrimination represented about one for every 12,500 class members, relating to only some 235 of Wal-Mart's 3,400 stores. The majority further noted that half the reports were concentrated in only six states (Alabama, California, Florida, Missouri, Texas and Wisconsin); half of all states had only one or two anecdotes; and 14 states had no reports of Wal-Mart's operations at all. Surveying this anecdotal evidence, the majority concluded: "Even if every single one of the accounts is true, that would not demonstrate that the entire company 'operate[s] under a general policy of discrimination.'" Wal-Mart, slip op. at 18.

Ginsburg objected to the majority's dismissal of the women's anecdotal evidence, arguing that the majority misread the Court's Teamsters decision, which "can hardly be said to establish a numerical floor before anecdotal evidence can be taken into account." Id. at 5 n.4 (J. Ginsburg, dissenting). For Ginsburg, the women's tales of their own experiences suggested that gender bias suffused Wal-Mart's company culture, and therefore "the District Court's identification of a common question—whether Wal-Mart's pay and promotions policies gave rise to unlawful discrimination—was hardly infirm." Id. at 6.

A Longing Look At Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes Et Al

Canadian class action defence lawyers may have reacted with a hint of envy towards their American counterparts when the United States Supreme Court released the decision in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes et al on June 20, 2011.

The decision overturned the granting of certification by the lower courts in the context of a claim under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Current and former employees of Wal-Mart had sought certification on behalf of 1.5 million female employees because of alleged discrimination against women.

One of the key issues in the case was whether the petitioner satisfied Rule 23 (a)(2) of the United States Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, namely that there were questions of fact or law common to the class.

Significantly, the plaintiffs did not allege thatWal-Mart had an express corporate policy against the advancement of women. Rather they claimed that local managers' discretion over pay and promotion was exercised disproportionately in favour of men, the theory being that a strong and uniform "corporate culture" permitted bias to infect the discretionary decision-making of each Wal-Mart manager at the local store or regional level.

The point of interest to Canadian companies and practitioners is the comparative degree of vigour exercised by the United States Supreme Court in analyzing the claim for certification.

The majority cautioned that the requirement for a common question of fact or law is easy to misread since any competently crafted class complaint or statement of claim, literally read, necessarily raises common "questions." The key to determining whether a question of fact or law is truly common to the class, the Court explained, is whether the same proof will be used to answer that question as to each class member such that prosecution of the plaintiffs' claims "will produce a common answer to the crucial question."

Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading standard. Instead, a party seeking certification must affirmatively prove each element of the Rule. Further, the Court emphasized that a trial court must subject the proof offered in support of class certification to a "rigorous analysis," including weighing disputed expert testimony, even if that analysis overlaps with the merits of the plaintiffs' underlying claims. The Court then held that the plaintiffs failed to prove under Rule 23(a)(2) that there were, in fact, common questions of law or fact.

By contrast, counsel from the United States or defendant corporations from the United States are often surprised when they are involved in class action certification hearings in Canada. The class action legislation of Provinces in Canada requires the court to find that there are common issues of law or fact and to find the issue is a substantial ingredient of each class member's claim. However, this is where the analyses of the courts diverge.

The evidential burden on an applicant for class certification in Canadian proceedings is lower than the standard espoused in the Wal-Mart decision. This is particularly true in Québec where the rights of defendants to adduce evidence to counter certification are more restricted than in the rest of Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada has described the burden on an applicant as showing, "some basis in fact to support the certification order." The standard has been interpreted as a lower threshold than that applied in the Wal-Mart decision.

The difference can result in asymmetrical management of cross-border disputes in the United States and Canada. The number of potential claimants and the financial exposure in the United States will dwarf Canadian exposures, but in several areas of substantive law, there is a greater chance of class certification in Canada.

This raises strategic and other issues on the choice of venue for litigation and the defence of the claim, including issues such as the jury culture in the United States, the more common practice of judge alone trials in Canada, choice of law, as well as considerations of issue estoppel and enforcement of settlements and judgments in the companion jurisdiction.

These are complex decisions, but if there is going to be some convergence of legal principles, Canadian class action defence lawyers would welcome movement towards the United States' burden of proof on class action petitioners.

Aug 09, 2011 (The Namibian/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- SINCE Independence, the Namibian Government has repeatedly called for foreign investments as the engine for development and job creation in the country.

Globally, the most common form of foreign direct investment (FDI) has been the practice of mergers and acquisitions. At first sight, it thus seems strange that the Namibian government and the Namibia Competition Commission (NCC) are concerned about the intended take-over of 51% of Massmart by the American retail giant Wal-Mart at a cost of N$16,5 billion.

In February this year, the NCC approved the merger with conditions mainly relating to the protection of employment and Small and Medium-Size Enterprises (SMEs).

This was done in line with the Namibia Competitions Act of 2003 which enables the Commission to promote employment and the social and economic welfare of Namibians. Wal-Mart appealed against these conditions and in June the Namibian High Court ruled in favour of the merger without any conditions attached.

This ruling is now being appealed against by the NCC and the Supreme Court will have to make a final decision. In response to the High Court ruling, Trade and Industry Minister Hage Geingob pointed out that "the judgement may have far reaching implications for the future economic development of Namibia, and in particular the empowerment of Namibians, whom the then apartheid South African administration have severely disadvantaged..."

He further stated that "the law needs to be contextualised for the greater public good other than a strict technical interpretation thereof."

This article will explore the reasons why the Wal-Mart take-over is so controversial in Namibia and South Africa.

Who is Wal-Mart?

Wal-Mart is the largest retailer in the world. Its yearly revenues are larger than those of most countries, including Switzerland. The company runs its stores on a simple set of principles: goods are sold at the lowest possible price, mark-ups are low in relation to the actual costs of production and turn-over is extremely fast. This system places enormous pressure to cut costs at all levels of operations: production, distribution and retailing. While consumers may benefit from lower prices, the opposite holds true for those involved in the production- and retail chains.

Cut-throat competition between producers results in a downward spiral of working conditions. Namibian workers experienced this at the infamous Ramatex textile company a few years ago. This company was heavily supported by government and even received generous subsidies in the hope of creating long-term employment. However, it closed down after just a few years. Incidentally, Ramatex was one of the suppliers of Wal-Mart.

At retail level, Wal-Mart cuts costs by employing unskilled, non-unionised workers and by reducing the number of staff through self-serve stores. Wal-Mart has cemented its dominant global position over the years by increasingly using information technology for the handling of goods and people. It gained control over its suppliers, it extended its global reach, it engaged in ruthless labour practices and it exploited the loopholes created by a lax neo-liberal economic policy framework. Wal-Mart has become the dominant market for many manufacturers who have become dependent on the retail giant.

Wal-Mart shapes the structure and location of manufacturers and forces them into the same low-wage, low-cost system that is known as the global sweat shop system. Today, an increasing number of manufacturers have to accept Wal-Mart's requirements, for example regarding costs and delivery times.

Wal-Mart has taken full advantage of the opportunities created by globalisation to move production sites across borders. Today, it imports most of its goods from China but the company is on a constant look-out for locations where production might be even cheaper. Wal-Mart thus represents the ultimate logic of cut-throat competition in the global economy. Its dominant position allows it to influence wages and working conditions not only amongst its suppliers but often in countries as a whole.

Union-bashing

Wal-Mart has a long-standing and well-documented history of union-bashing and driving down employment conditions of its staff. In the US alone, there are 15 rulings against the company by the National Labour Relations Board. In Mexico, a Supreme Court ruling compared the Wal-Mart labour practices to the corrupt and repressive conditions that Mexico had experienced under its dictator Parfirio Diaz. Practices such as cutting wages and employment benefits, blatant gender discrimination, preventing staff from joining trade unions, dismissing union activists and paying staff in coupons (which can only be used in Wal-Mart stores) are part of the company's operations. A report released in 2007 by Human Rights Watch stated that although Wal-Mart was not the only bad employer, the company "stands out for the sheer magnitude and aggressiveness of its anti-union apparatus".

Regulations?

In South Africa, trade unions and 3 government ministries challenged the Wal-Mart take-over in a Competition Tribunal earlier this year. The Tribunal approved the merger with several conditions: the establishment of a supplier development fund, no retrenchments for 2 years and employment preference for 503 workers who had been retrenched my Massmart in 2010. These retrenchments were widely seen as a "preparatory step" for the Wal-Mart take-over. Both the South African government and the country's trade unions have indicated that they will take the Wal-Mart case further. Even in free market economies, mergers and acquisitions have been recognised as not always being beneficial for a country's social and economic development. In Canada, for example, the take-over bid by BHP Bilton for Potash Corp. was blocked by the government because it was seen as holding no benefits for the country. Likewise, the Australian government blocked the Singapore Stock Exchange from taking over the Australian Stock Exchange. The Indian government is legally empowered to issue policy directives to the country's competition commission to safeguard public interests. Thus, placing conditions on mergers or blocking them altogether is a common practice to safeguard social and economic interests against rampant global capitalism and the large global corporations that drive it.

Wal-Mart's entry into Namibia and South Africa will have similar consequences to those experienced by other countries in recent years. The retail giant might offer goods at lower prices and lure consumers with slogans such as "Low prices will give people a raise every time they shop with us". The real price, however, will be paid by the workers employed by Wal-Mart and its suppliers. They will be confronted with extreme pressures and be forced to accept working conditions that will not allow them to meet even their most basic needs. Namibia's former Ramatex workers have experienced this first-hand!

From a developmental perspective, there are many questions to be asked: are some conditions like those placed upon Wal-Mart in South Africa enough to prevent such destructive consequences? Will Wal-Mart ever source from local suppliers? Are our laws sufficient to prevent the abuse of workers and the environment by corporate giants? Can we safeguard the interests of small, local businesses and workers while playing according to the rules of a ruthless global economy? Wal-Mart's track record clearly indicates that the retail giant is not concerned about local development needs and thus it would be naive to believe that its behaviour in Namibia and South Africa would be different. The time has come to learn from history, to become selective when dealing with investments and to implement a development strategy that delivers social benefits such as overcoming poverty, meeting basic needs and creating decent jobs. Wal-Mart has nothing to offer in this regard.

Today's column is the second of a two-part series discussing numerous rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court during the 2010-11 term in the area of labor and employment law.

Employee Class

In Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S.Ct. 2541 (June 20, 2011), the Court held 5-4 that a large and diverse class—encompassing approximately 1.5 million female employees, both salaried and hourly with a range of positions, who are or were employed at one or more of Wal-Mart's 3,400 stores across the country—was not properly certified by a lower court.

The plaintiffs alleged that Wal-Mart violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by denying them equal pay or promotions and discriminating against them on the basis of their sex. The plaintiffs claimed that their local managers' discretion is exercised disproportionately in favor of men and leads to a disparate impact on female employees. They further claimed that Wal-Mart's awareness of this effect amounts to disparate treatment. The plaintiffs requested injunctive and declaratory relief, punitive damages, and individualized monetary relief in the form of back pay. The district court certified the proposed class, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit substantially affirmed the certification.

The Supreme Court reversed and held that class treatment was not appropriate under Rule 23(a) or Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Court emphasized that Rule 23(a)'s "commonality" requirement is not "a mere pleading standard," and that a party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate that the class members "have suffered the same injury," and their claims "depend upon a common contention."

In its analysis of such commonality requirement, the Court stated that there was no significant proof that Wal-Mart operated under a general policy of discrimination. The Court rejected the testimony by the plaintiffs' sociological expert that Wal-Mart has a corporate culture that makes it vulnerable to gender bias. In addition, the Court found that the plaintiffs' statistical evidence about gender disparities at the regional and national level does not demonstrate disparities at individual stores, and even if it did, factors such as the availability of qualified women in certain areas work against an inference of discrimination. The Court also found that the plaintiffs' anecdotal evidence failed to satisfy the commonality requirement, especially considering that the plaintiffs' affidavits were concentrated on incidents that occurred in a small number of states.

Separately, the Court concluded that plaintiffs' claims for back pay were improperly certified under Rule 23(b)(2). Rule 23(b)(2) allows for class certification when "the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole" and, thus, it does not authorize class certification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award. The Court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that their back pay claims satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) because those claims do not "predominate" over their claims for injunctive and declaratory relief, saying that the predominance theory has no basis in the text of the rules governing class actions.

Immigration Law

In Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. Whiting, 131 S.Ct. 1968 (May 26, 2011), the Court ruled 5-3 that the Legal Arizona Workers Act (LAWA), an Arizona statute that imposes sanctions on employers who hire unauthorized aliens, is valid under the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), a federal statute that expressly preempts "any State or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ... unauthorized aliens."

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, businesses and civil rights organizations challenged the LAWA, which provides that the licenses of state employers that knowingly or intentionally employ unauthorized aliens may be, and in certain circumstances, must be, suspended or revoked. The law also mandates that all Arizona employers must use E-Verify, a federal Internetbased verification system, to confirm that the workers they employ are legally authorized workers. The plaintiffs argued that the LAWA provisions were both expressly and impliedly preempted by the IRCA, and that Arizona's requirement to use E-Verify was impliedly preempted because Congress had made the program voluntary at the federal level.

The district court held that the LAWA was not preempted because it does no more than impose licensing conditions on businesses operating within Arizona. With respect to E-Verify, the court found that Congress had expressed no intent to prevent states from mandating participation. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.

The Supreme Court affirmed, stating that the LAWA is not expressly preempted because the IRCA preserves state authority to impose sanctions "through licensing and similar laws." The Court also concluded that the LAWA is not impliedly preempted because Arizona's procedures simply implement the sanctions that Congress expressly permitted and because regulating in-state businesses through licensing laws is not a uniquely federal area of interest. Finally, the Court reasoned that Arizona's E-Verify mandate is not impliedly preempted because the federal statute establishing E-Verify contains no language circumscribing state action.

Attorney's Fees

In Fox v. Vice, 131 S.Ct. 2205 (June 6, 2011), the Court unanimously held that a defendant in a federal civil rights lawsuit may recover reasonable attorney's fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act (42 USC §1988) if a plaintiff has asserted both frivolous and non-frivolous claims, but only attorney's fees that the defendant would not have incurred but for the frivolous claims. This decision will clearly impact employment cases because §1988's attorney's fee provision applies to employment discrimination claims made under 42 USC §1981, and Title VII's and the Americans with Disabilities Act's attorney's fee provisions contain wording substantially similar to that of §1988.

Ricky Fox and Billy Ray Vice were candidates during an election for chief of police in Vinton, La. Fox alleged that Vice used "dirty tricks" to try to force Fox out of the race. Fox filed suit in Louisiana state court, alleging state and federal claims, and Vice removed the case to federal court on the basis of the federal claims. The district court dismissed the federal claims and remanded the state claims. Vice then asked for attorney's fees for both the federal and state claims under 42 USC 1988. The district court granted Vice's motion for attorney's fees for all of the claims, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed.

The Supreme Court stated that the appropriate question is: What is the work for which the defendant may receive fees when the dispute involves work that helps defend against non-frivolous and frivolous claims alike? The Court concluded that §1988 permits the defendant to receive only the portion of his fees that he would not have paid but for the frivolous claim. In other words, the standard for awarding reasonable attorney's fees is not whether attorney costs relate to a frivolous or non-frivolous claim, but whether the costs would have been incurred in the absence of the frivolous claim. Because the district court and the Fifth Circuit failed to apply the appropriate "but-for" standard, the Court vacated the judgment of the Fifth Circuit and remanded the case.

ERISA Relief

In CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, 131 S.Ct. 1866 (May 16, 2011), the Court unanimously ruled that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act §502(a)(1)(B) does not give a district court authority to reform the terms of a pension plan as written. A majority of the justices found, however, that such relief may be available as "appropriate equitable relief" under ERISA §502(a)(3), pursuant to the equitable remedies of estoppel, reformation or surcharge. Rather than impose a uniform burden of proof for sustaining a claim for such relief, the Court stated that the required burden of proof would depend on the specific equitable remedy being sought.

When CIGNA changed the nature of its pension plan, a class of approximately 25,000 beneficiaries of the plan challenged CIGNA's adoption of the new plan, arguing that the notice CIGNA provided about the change and summary plan descriptions explaining the new plan's features were misleading and downplayed how the new plan would be less beneficial.

The district court agreed that the disclosures made by CIGNA violated its obligation under ERISA, and ordered CIGNA to reform the pension plan document to accord with the terms in the summary plan descriptions and pay benefits according to these more generous terms. The district court held that §502(a)(1)(B) provided the authority to order this relief. That section states that a "civil action may be brought" by a plan "participant or beneficiary...to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan." The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.

The Supreme Court vacated and remanded, concluding that §502(a)(1)(B) grants a court the power to enforce, not change, the terms of the plan. The Court said that instead of relying on §502(a)(1) (B), the district court should have relied on §502(a)(3), which allows a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary "to obtain other appropriate equitable relief" to remedy violations of ERISA "or the terms of the plan." The Court emphasized that the relief ordered by the district court could be achieved through traditional forms of equitable relief, such as the remedies of estoppel, reformation, and surcharge. Looking to the law of equity, the Court then stated that proof of detrimental reliance is not necessarily required before a remedy is decreed and, to the extent any such requirement arises, it is because the specific remedy being contemplated imposes such a requirement.

First Amendment

In Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri, 131 S.Ct. 2488 (June 20, 2011), the Court ruled 8-1 that a government employer's alleged retaliation against an employee for filing a grievance does not give rise to liability under the First Amendment Petition Clause unless the employee's grievance is a matter of public concern.

Charles Guarnieri filed a union grievance challenging his termination as chief of police against the council for the borough of Duryea in Pennsylvania. After an arbitrator ordered him reinstated, the council issued 11 directives that instructed Guarnieri in the performance of his duties. Guarnieri filed an additional union grievance that challenged the directives, and the arbitrator instructed the council to modify or withdraw some of the directives.

Guarnieri then filed a lawsuit in federal district court, claiming that his first grievance was protected by the Petition Clause of the First Amendment and that the council's directives, as well as denial of overtime pay to Guarnieri, constituted unlawful retaliation. A jury found in favor of Guarnieri, awarding him compensatory and punitive damages and attorney's fees. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the award of compensatory damages (but not punitive damages) holding that government employers may be liable under the Petition Clause even if petitions of government employees do not relate to matters of public concern.

The Supreme Court vacated and remanded, holding that claims brought under the Petition Clause are subject to the same "public concern" test as those brought under the Speech Clause. The Court reasoned that the government has existing statutory and regulatory schemes to protect the rights of employees and that the Petition Clause is not an instrument for public employees to circumvent these schemes. Moreover, a different rule for the Speech Clause and the Petition Clause would add to the "complexity and expense of compliance with the Constitution."

The Court applied the "Pickering" framework, which is used to govern Speech Clause claims by public employees, to the Petition Clause context. According to the framework established in Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 US 563, 568 (1968), if a public employee petitions on a matter of private concern, the First Amendment interest must give way. On the other hand, if a public employee petitions on a matter of public concern, the First Amendment interest must be balanced with the government's interest in efficient management of its affairs. The Court concluded that the right of a public employee under the Petition Clause is "not a right to transform everyday employment disputes into matters for constitutional litigation in the federal courts."

Righting the Class Action Ship: Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes

On June 20, 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion that will alter how certain class actions are defined and litigated in the lower federal courts. Specifically, the Court:

Rejected the notion that Wal-Mart's alleged policy of giving local managers discretion regarding pay and promotion decisions presented common issues of law or fact best addressed in a Rule 23(a)(2) class action.

Held that class action claims for monetary relief may not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) where the monetary relief (such as back pay) "is not incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief" demanded by the plaintiffs.

Held that a party seeking class certification must prove in fact that Rule 23 requirements are satisfied, even if the issues overlap the merits and must be proven again at trial.

Held that claims for individual monetary relief cannot be replaced with "Trial by Formula," where damages are determined by a formula derived from a sample of cases.

Rule 23(a)(2) "Commonality" – The Glue that Binds

In Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, the Supreme Court rejected the lower court's decision to allow certification of a class of 1.5 million current and former female employees in 3,400 Wal-Mart stores throughout the U.S. for alleged Title VII employment discrimination claims. Writing for the 5-4 majority, Justice Antonin Scalia stated that the "crux of the case is commonality" which "requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class members 'have suffered the same injury.'" Plaintiffs' "claims must depend upon a common contention – for example, the assertion of discriminatory bias on the part of the same supervisor." Furthermore, that "common contention . . . must be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution – which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke."

Noting that the plaintiffs "wish to sue about literally millions of employment decisions at once," the Court stated that "[w]ithout some glue holding the alleged reasons for all of those decisions together, it will be impossible to say that examination of all the class members' claims for relief will produce a common answer to the crucial question why I was disfavored." Without the answer to that question, the Court held that class wide treatment is inappropriate.

Back Pay Claims Cannot Be Certified Under Rule 23(b)(2) as Incidental Relief

The unanimous Court held that back pay claims cannot be certified under Rule 23(b)(2) as incidental to injunctive relief if such claims require case-specific inquiry. The Court was skeptical that any monetary claim could be certified under Rule 23(b)(2), but declined to rule out purely incidental monetary claims, saying "[w]e need not decide whether there are any forms of 'incidental' monetary relief that are consistent with the interpretation of Rule 23(b)(2) that we have announced and that comply with the Due Process Clause." The Court concluded that "Wal-Mart is entitled to individualized determinations of each employee's eligibility for back pay."

Until this ruling, back pay was one of the classic examples of incidental relief. Consequently, this holding considerably narrows Rule 23(b)(2)'s application to injunction claims with any monetary component and places in question whether any form of monetary relief can be sought under 23(b)(2).

Plaintiffs Must Prove that Rule 23 Requirements are Satisfied

The Court held that the proponent of class certification must prove in fact that the elements of Rule 23 are satisfied. The Court further held that in so doing, the trial court may decide class certification issues that overlap the merits, with those issues to be proved again at trial. The Court did not address the proponent's burden on proving issues of fact, a standard on which the circuits differ. The Court also did not decide whether expert opinion evidence submitted in support of class certification must meet Daubert standards of admissibility, although it expressed skepticism that Daubert did not apply to the certification stage.

Damages May Not be Determined by "Trial by Formula"

The Court also ruled that the requirement for individual adjudication of damages cannot be replaced with what the Court called "Trial by Formula." In the earlier federal appeals court ruling, the Ninth Circuit approved replacing individual adjudication with a formula developed from a sample of cases. The Court ruled that this approach violated the Rules Enabling Act by using a procedural mechanism to alter substantive rights, stating "[w]e disapprove that novel project." Thus, the Court held that the need to assess damages individually prevented back pay claims from being incidental to injunctive relief, "... even assuming, arguendo, that 'incidental' monetary relief can be awarded to a (b)(2) class."

Skepticism Regarding the Plaintiffs' Proof

The Supreme Court also was very skeptical of the sociological and statistical evidence offered by the plaintiffs, which is likely to have a significant impact on how lower courts view the evidence plaintiffs often proffer in support of their class action allegations. For example, in Wal-Mart, the plaintiffs proffered the testimony of an alleged sociological expert who opined that Wal-Mart has a "'strong corporate culture,' that makes it 'vulnerable' to 'gender bias.'" He could not specify, however, "how regularly stereotypes play a meaningful role in employment decisions at Wal-Mart." In fact, his analysis was so indeterminate that he had to concede at his deposition "that he could not calculate whether 0.5 percent or 95 percent of the employment decisions at Wal-Mart might be determined by stereotyped thinking."

The Supreme Court disregarded this expert's testimony and was skeptical that his opinions were even admissible. The Court also was not persuaded by the 120 affidavits offered by the plaintiffs, which represented only 1 out of every 12,500 potential class members and related to only a tiny fraction of Wal-Mart's 3,400 stores.

Implications of the Court's Decision

The most immediate impact of the Court's decision is that it negates the largest employment class action ever certified in any U.S. court. To certify and sustain a class action, plaintiffs must now define the common question which leads to the common answer – that is, the "glue" that holds together the alleged reasons for all of the challenged employment decisions.

In addition, the Court's decision will be felt beyond the Title VII gender discrimination context. The Court's holding and reasoning, both the unanimous Rule 23(b)(2) ruling and the 5-4 Rule 23(a)(2) ruling, apply equally to other employment statutes, and by implication, may have a profound impact on the way classes are defined in wage and hour and consumer protection litigation.

In a decision much anticipated by employers, the US Supreme Court ruled on June 20 that a trial court erred in certifying the largest plaintiff class in employment class-action history. The class consisted of about 1.5 million female employees -- every woman employed for any period of time during the past decade in any of Wal-Mart's approximately 3,400 US stores. The high court reversed the 9th Circuit's holding. The named plaintiffs were claiming that Wal-Martdiscriminated against women in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The high court ruled unanimously that the certification was not consistent with federal rules governing class actions, though some justices dissented in part.

In a decision much anticipated by employers, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on June 20 that a trial court erred in certifying the largest plaintiff class in employment class-action history.

The class consisted of about 1.5 million female employees-every woman employed for any period of time during the past decade in any of Wal-Mart's approximately 3,400 U.S. stores. It was certified by a California district court, and the certification decision was upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (Dukes v. Wal-Mart, No. 10-277). The high court reversed the 9th Circuit's holding.

The named plaintiffs were claiming that Wal-Martdiscriminated against women in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. They claimed that local managers exercised discretion over pay and promotions disproportionately in favor of men.

The high court ruled unanimously that the certification was not consistent with federal rules governing class actions, though some justices dissented in part. The majority opinion, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, concluded that the types of claims asserted were not the types of claims that lent themselves to determination in a class-action proceeding.

Further, "significant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination" was absent, the majority opinion noted. The plaintiffs' only evidence of a general discrimination policy was a sociologist's analysis asserting that Wal-Mart's corporate culture made it vulnerable to gender bias.

However, because the expert could not estimate what percentage of Wal-Mart's employment decisions might be determined by stereotypical thinking, his testimony was worlds away from "significant proof" that Wal-Mart "operated under a general policy of discrimination," Scalia found.

Antitrust Law
Antitrust Defendants Should Applaud 'Wal-Mart' Ruling; Decertification of Mammoth Class Action Paints Difficult Landscape for Plaintiffs

On June 20, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision when it decided Wal-Mart v. Dukes, and decertified what would have been "one of the most expansive class actions ever." In a 5-4 decision, the court, in an opinion authored by Justice Antonin Scalia, found that the plaintiffs failed to meet the "commonality" requirement for class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), reversing both the district court and 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a dissent joined by Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, strongly disagreed with the majority and argued that the district court's finding of commonality "was hardly infirm."

However, in a section of the opinion joined by all nine justices, the court held that, even where the commonality requirement is met, Rule 23(b)(2) will not support a class action in which the plaintiffs are seeking individualized monetary relief, as were the plaintiffs in Dukes. Undoubtedly, the impact of Dukes will be far reaching not only for employment discrimination class actions, but for all types of class actions, including in the antitrust context.

The named plaintiffs in Dukes were two current employees and one former employee of Wal-Mart. They filed a class action on behalf of more than 1.5 million current and former female Wal-Mart employees, claiming that the retail giant discriminated against them on the basis of their sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The plaintiffs alleged that local managers favored men over women when making decisions regarding pay and promotions. The plaintiffs did not argue, however, that Wal-Mart had a corporate policy of sex discrimination. Instead, they claimed that the local managers exercised their discretion in a discriminatory manner, and that Wal-Mart knew about this, yet refused to stop it. The plaintiffs' complaint sought injunctive relief, declaratory relief, punitive damages and backpay.

In decertifying the class, the Supreme Court majority took particular issue with the fact that plaintiffs failed to establish the second prerequisite of Rule 23(a) — commonality. In order to establish commonality, the class representative must prove that "there are questions of law or fact common to the class." The court held that commonality requires a showing that the class members "suffered the same injury," not just that they "suffered a violation of the same provision of law." Even if common questions are raised en masse, what is essential to class certification is that the class action generates, the court stated, "common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation."

The plaintiffs in Dukes, however, sought recovery based on varied employment decisions without an underlying corporate policy of discrimination to support those decisions. An examination of each individual plaintiff's claims for relief would not have produced common answers proving a pattern or practice of sex discrimination necessary to support a Title VII class action. Indeed, one piece of evidence offered by the plaintiffs to show a pattern or practice of sex discrimination was the testimony of a sociological expert who, Scalia noted, "could not calculate whether 0.5 percent or 95 percent of the employment decisions at Wal-Mart might be determined by stereotyped thinking." This same expert also presented statistical analyses, which aimed to demonstrate a culture of gender bias and discrimination.

The majority found this evidence to be "worlds away from 'significant proof' that Wal-Mart 'operated under a general policy of discrimination.'" The single policy that this evidence did prove was "a policy against having uniform employment practices," which, by itself, does not suggest a corporate practice of sex discrimination.

The dissent, however, argued that discretionary decision-making, in actuality, lends itself to a heightened risk of discrimination, particularly when the decision-makers are "predominantly of one sex, and are steeped in a corporate culture that perpetuates stereotypes." In fact, as Ginsburg pointed out, the court has previously held that discretionary decision-making can support Title VII claims, "not only when such practices are motivated by discriminatory intent, but also when they produce discriminatory results."

In addition to discounting the plaintiffs' expert and his statistics, Scalia also found on appeal, for class certification purposes, that the plaintiffs' anecdotal evidence of specific instances of discrimination was not sufficient enough to suggest that all discretionary employment decisions were discriminatory. The dissent stressed that plaintiffs' anecdotal evidence, which included accounts of female associates being referred to as "little Janie Qs," and managers telling employees that "men are here to make a career and women aren't," was sufficient to suggest that discrimination saturated the corporate culture at Wal-Mart. Nevertheless, the majority discredited the plaintiffs' evidence, which suggests that evidence of commonality will no longer be taken at face value. Instead, plaintiffs will be required to "touch aspects of the merits in order to resolve preliminary matters."

Additionally, the court unanimously disagreed with the plaintiffs' use of Rule 23(b) (2) in requesting backpay. Rule 23(b)(2) applies when "the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole." Even where the commonality requirement is met, Rule 23(b)(2) will not support a class action in which the plaintiffs are seeking individualized monetary relief.

The court explained that the basic foundation of Rule 23(b)(2) is that the declaratory or injunctive relief requested be applicable to all members of the class. The rule does not provide for class certification when each member of the class would be entitled to individualized injunctive relief, and certainly does not provide for class certification when each member of the class would be entitled to individualized monetary relief. Class certification in this instance, the court ruled, must be sought under Rule 23(b)(3), which includes several procedural protections that 23(b)(2) lacks, including predominance, superiority, mandatory notice and the right to opt out.

This landmark decision is sure to have sweeping implications in the antitrust arena. The use of class actions is a common tool in antitrust enforcement, and, until recently, the certification of antitrust classes was often a relatively low hurdle to clear. Courts typically accepted the substantive allegations of a complaint as true, and did not consider the merits of a claim when ruling on class certification. Certification was rarely denied in antitrust actions for failure to meet the commonality requirement. In fact, a single common question typically was usually sufficient to support certification.

Over the past few years, select courts had started raising the bar for antitrust class certification. Even before Dukes, courts in some circuits began insisting on a more in-depth analysis on the merits before certifying a class. For example, in 2008, In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litigation, decided by then-Chief Judge Anthony J. Scirica and Judges Thomas L. Ambro and D. Michael Fisher of the 3rd Circuit, clarified the requirements for class certification. In the unanimous opinion, authored by Scirica, the court reversed Judge Stewart Dalzell's class certification and stated that proper certification of a class requires "findings by the court, not merely a 'threshold showing' by a party, that each requirement of Rule 23 is met."

The court further stated that, in certifying a class, all factual and legal issues must be resolved, "even if they overlap with the merits." Hydrogen Peroxide demonstrates that prior to Dukes, the 3rd Circuit began requiring that antitrust plaintiffs make more than a cursory pleading of the requirements for class certification. What Dukes now adds to the mix is the solidification, or at least the confirmation, of a more elevated standard of proof for not only commonality, but for all the prerequisites and requirements of antitrust class certification.

The resulting landscape that Dukes paints for the future of antitrust class actions will be rugged and challenging. Class certification will be out of reach for some antitrust plaintiffs and the plaintiffs' class action bar. Indeed, Dukes makes clear that plaintiffs in antitrust class actions will now be required to "touch aspects of the merits" in order to prove that they not only "suffered the same injury," but also "suffered a violation of the same law." Establishing these requirements for class certification will be difficult. This will be particularly so in antitrust cases that, for example, concern health care class actions that rely on individual medical diagnoses and differing injuries or cases where individual consumer decisions as to product choice are at issue.

Proving particular practices of antitrust defendants to be illegal is still no easier than it was for the plaintiffs in Dukes to prove the discriminatory corporate practices of Wal-Mart. This is especially true with the threshold Twombly/Iqbal hurdles in place.

The new precedent established by Dukes now means that antitrust class action plaintiffs will need to have the true grit to meet the enhanced standard of proof to launch burdensome class actions. The days of filing a class action based on nothing more than the pendency of a non-public government antitrust investigation appear over. The impact of Dukes on antitrust class actions should result in fewer class actions being filed.

This was perhaps the intended consequence of the Supreme Court majority's decision in Dukes rendered during the frenzy of expensive and burdensome class actions that have plagued both corporate America and the courts for years. Whatever the motivating policy considerations at play, antitrust class actions that are filed in the future will have a much harder time passing muster with the courts for class certification. Stay tuned.

Walmart's new urban strategy comes with a lousy track record.

WALMART HAS launched a charm offensive as part of its new urban strategy to impose smaller versions of its big box in inner cities across the country. It has proposed four stores for Washington, D. C. - all in predominantly minority, and most in low-income, neighborhoods.

The debate over building Walmart stores in D.C. is engaging intense public sentiment, and for good reason. While Walmart promises new jobs in a community, in reality it displaces other local businesses, leaving in question whether there is a net jobs gain; one study showed that for every retail job Walmart brought, communities lost 1.4 other jobs. In addition, Walmart passes on the cost of its low wages to taxpayers when associates and their families rely on publicly funded health care and other assistance programs.

Walmart promises D.C. 1,200 retail jobs and some 400 in the construction industrybut the company's well-documented track record is all the evidence the affected communities need to sound the alarm and demand proof for promises.

In Chicago, when Walmart made its first foray into the urban market, it made initial oral agreements for worker and community protections - pledges on which the big-box retailer later reneged. There was nothing in writing to force Walmart to Uve up to the promises that had won it a pass into the community.

The Washington Metropolitan Labor Council, aligning with community activists, environmentalists, clergy, and small businesses, has thrown down the gaundet with a simple retort to Walmart: Respect D.C.

Our proposed community benefits agreement asks Walmart to commit, in writing, to responsible corporate citizenship. This means paying living wages, hiring and training D.C. residents, using responsible local contractors, protecting the city's natural environment, mitigating negative impacts on traffic and community safety, providing incentives and assistance to small businesses, and allowing local businesses opportunities to advertise and market products in Walmart stores.

Walmart's reputation for labor abuses is legendary. In addition to being the subject of what was the largest class-action suit in US. history by female employees, the corporation has been forced to settle scores of employee wage-theft lawsuits and discrimination complaints.

Despite Walmart's claim that their fulltime workers in the area make an hourly wage of $12.49, in reality many hourly employees at stores around the country and in the D.C. metro area have yet to attain that figure. Worse, many long-time workers never see that figure because Walmart systematically creates part-time positions to avoid paying standard wages and health benefits. According to an independent market research group, the average "associate" at Walmart makes $8.81 per hour. Even if such a worker is allowed to work 34 hours a week, which is what Walmart considers full-time status, this equals only $15,576 per year. In contrast, Walmart CEO Mike Duke received $18.7 rnillion in total compensation during 2010.

Walmart can easily afford to pay living wages and health care; a recent study by the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California at Berkeley established that if Walmart started paying a minimum wage of $12 per hour to all its associates currently earning $9 or less per hour, it would only raise the average cost of a visit to Walmart by 46 cents. A whopping 41.4 percent of such a pay increase would go to workers in families with total incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level.

In a city like D.C, where poverty rates have skyrocketed beyond the national averages, Walmart has the potential to greatly impact our future, for better or for worse.

More than just a fight against Walmart, this is a call for social justice; our city must demand the respect that it deserves. Walmart can afford to be a responsible corporate neighbor. D.C. cannot afford the alternative.

People of faith joined activists and victims of violence on a 12-state tour that also visited El Paso, Texas, demanding an end to the "Mérida Initiative" and that the U.S. reduce drug consumption as part of stopping the violence.

THE U.S. SUPREME COURT HANDED A sweeping victory to Wal-Mart in June in the company's decade-long effort to thwart a discrimination class action filed on behalf of more than 1 million current and former female employees. The ruling is likely to hobble other large employment class actions as well.

Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for a 5-to-4 majority, said the plaintiffs failed to provide proof of a common companywide policy of discrimination necessary to certify a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(2). "To sue about literally millions of employment decisions at once, [plaintiffs] need some glue holding the alleged reasons for all those decisions together," he said, summarizing his ruling from the bench. He added that the plaintiffs' evidence of commonality was "entirely absent" and "worlds away" from what is required under the Court's 1982 Falcon precedent.

In a separate, unanimous part of the ruling that amounted to a one-two punch, the Court also said that the plaintiffs' quest for back pay in addition to injunctive relief ran afoul of rule 23(b) (2) of the federal rules. Scalia dismissed that effort as "a sort of trial by formula," which would award back pay based on a sample set of plaintiffs. "Wal-Mart is entitled to individualized determinations of each employee's eligibility for back pay," Scalia declared.

The long-awaited ruling in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes broke along ideological as well as gender lines. All three women on the Court—Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan—dissented, joined by Justice Stephen Breyer. Ginsburg's dissent said that the plaintiffs' evidence showed that "gender bias suffused Wal-Mart's company culture." The conservative majority was led by Scalia and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, Jr., and justices Samuel Alito, Jr., Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas.

"This class action is over," says Theodore Boutrous of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, who argued the case last April for Wal-Mart, the nation's largest employer. Other big class actions, including a suit against Costco Wholesale Corporation, could be affected, Boutrous notes. Despite plaintiffs' claims otherwise, Boutrous adds that the decision "doesn't leave the [Wal-Mart] plaintiffs any running room" to reconfigure a class action in smaller form.

Joseph Sellers of Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, who argued the case for the Wal-Mart women, disagrees. While the decision "substantially raised the hurdles workers have to surmount" to gain certification as a class, Sellers says, the Wal-Mart litigation could continue "splintered in many pieces."

Brad Seligman, another lead lawyer for the workers at Wal-Mart, agrees. "This case is not over," he says. "Wal-Mart is not off the hook." Women will now be able to file individual claims against the company with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and eventually in court, he observes: "The Court has not ruled that Wal-Mart did not discriminate."

Women's groups view the ruling as a blow to the campaign for workplace equality. Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, called the decision a "deep and painful disappointment to all of us who care about ending employment discrimination in this country, and a setback for the women of Wal-Mart and women workers everywhere." Says National Organization for Women president Terry O'Neill: "This Court has turned its back on the more than 1 million women who only sought simple justice. The women of Wal-Mart deserve respect and fair treatment, and we will continue to stand up for their rights." O'Neill says women's rights advocates would push for passage of a pending bill called the Paycheck Fairness Act.

Critics of the ruling say big companies now will be able to defeat class certification by hiding behind seemingly decentralized personnel policies that nonetheless disadvantage women or minorities. To meet the Court's articulated standard, says David Sanford of plaintiffs firm Sanford Wittels & Heisler, plaintiffs would have to prove that Wal-Mart had "a sign in each of its premises that reads "Women Paid Less than Men at Wal-Mart: Apply Here."

But business advocates applaud the Court's adoption of a high standard of proof for class certification. "Today's ruling reinforces a fundamental principle of fairness in our court systems: that defendants should have the opportunity to present individualized evidence to show they complied with the law," said Robin Conrad, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's National Chamber Litigation Center, in a statement. "Too often the class action device is twisted and abused to force businesses to choose between settling meritless lawsuits or potentially facing financial ruin."

The decision will make it harder for plaintiffs to use statistics and extrapolations to show that class members have common issues or to calculate remedies. "Trial by formula cannot transform individualized issues into common ones," says Don Falk of Mayer Brown, in reaction to the ruling.

T.J. HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR: Well, as we get close to the top of the hour, I'll give you a look at some of the stories making news across the country.

Starting in Wichita, where this must be the best lemonade on the planet, or maybe this Kansas businessman has some deep pockets. He paid $10,000 for a single glass of lemonade from some students. They were actually trying to raise money for tornado relief in Joplin, Missouri. They have actually raised more than $13,000 so far.

We turn to Michigan now, where, look at this. This is the one that almost got away. But it didn't. This took more than a half hour to reel in. That's a catfish. Now, the guy who caught it plans to have it officially measured and weighed to see if this thing officially breaks any records.

Also, are you in the market for a new car? Here's one that's an option for you. You've probably never seen anything quite like this. Let me explain what you are looking at. That's a Plexiglas Pontiac. It was built for the 1939 New York world's fair at a cost of about $25,000. It's being auctioned off today in Plymouth, Michigan; expected to sell for anywhere between $275,000 and $475,000.

And from the CNN Center in Atlanta, Georgia, this is your CNN SATURDAY MORNING. I'm glad you could spend some time here with us. I'm T.J. Holmes.

Well, you know the story by now. The world's biggest economy is on the brink of possible default. We are all watching and waiting as the fight over the nation's debt ceiling just drags on and on and on. Congress has just under three days left to come up with a deal. We are live in Washington to find out where things stand. And yes, they are in session this weekend.

Also, in this tough economy, would you believe that things are actually getting cheaper? Not all things, though, specific things. And we will reel them off for you this morning.

But first, we need to go right back to Capitol Hill. Both Houses of Congress are in session this weekend. Both parties are scrambling to pass some kind of a debt limit plan. Our Joe Johns is there for us.

Joe, good morning to you. This is about to get started here in about an hour.

JOE JOHNS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's for sure. And there's also a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes, we think. We don't know of any meetings between members of Congress, say, or Senators right now.

But a lot of this stuff goes under the staff level, particularly on the weekend. So we'll see. There's also a lot of discussion about what kind of bill that includes deficit reduction and raising the debt ceiling that the Congress would actually let go through.

I talked just a little while ago with Congressman Barney Frank, who is the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee. And he gave me an idea of what he believes needs to be in any bill that could get support from both Democrats and Republicans this weekend. Listen up.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. BARNEY FRANK (D), MASSACHUSETTS: Significant reductions going forward, not immediate, in domestic and military spending; deferring the tax issue for when the Bush tax cuts expire, so we can fight over that top two percent; and not cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits, so those but we can see if we can look at including in my point; further taxation of the upper income Social Security and Medicare benefits. I think that's a package that could pass.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

JOHNS: Now, what Barney Frank does not think will pass the House is the bill that passed the House last night. That, of course, is the bill that was put forward by the Speaker of the House, John Boehner. Boehner said he did everything he could and he really stuck his neck out. Listen to him.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), HOUSE SPEAKER: And to the American people I would say, we've tried our level best. We've done everything we can to find a common sense solution that could pass both Houses of Congress and end this crisis.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

JOHNS: So a lot of opinions out there. And I'm sure we'll be hearing more today, as these votes continue in the Senate and the House. Back to you, T.J.

HOLMES: All right. Joe Johns, we'll be checking in with you again. Thank you so much.

Meanwhile, this debt ceiling debate stirring a lot of reaction on Facebook, Twitter, other social networking sites, and President Obama used his re-election Twitter account to try to turn up the heat on Republicans.

Well, after his tweets went out, he lost more than 30,000 followers. That's according to the website Twittercounter. There's no way to know the political leanings of those folks who dropped the President. Now, even though he lost, the estimate is around 33,000 followers on Twitter, the President is going to be OK, because he has some nine million plus followers on Twitter.

Now, with so much at stake, how did we get down to the wire like this? I talked to a Democratic strategist, Maria Cardona, as well as Republican strategist, Lenny McAllister, a little earlier about what effect the Tea Party may be having on this whole debate.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

HOLMES: Do you see that the Tea Party, in your opinion, is not giving at all, and that's the holdup?

LENNY MCALLISTER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: There are some that are not giving. I'm not going to say everybody in that caucus, but there are definitely some that have been inflexible. The bottom line is, we didn't get here overnight and we're going to have to progress our way past and through this.

(CROSSTALK)

MCALLISTER: There were some that said that the Republicans had a big win, they should have taken advantage of it this time last week and got us past this crisis.

HOLMES: Well Maria, that some he may speak -- he may speak of, some could be one, two, three, four, or five, but those some seem pretty powerful right now.

MARIA CARDONA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, that's exactly the point, T.J. And I wrote a piece on CNN.com about this, it's called "The Tyranny of 87". Which is, when you put that much power in the hands of a very small group of people, especially people who have never governed before, have no interest in compromising, and are so inflexible and it's either their way or the highway, the American people at the end of the day are the ones who are going to get hurt because a couple things may happen.

If we go into default or if our credit rating is lowered to AA, which the Tea Partiers don't think is a big deal, there will be a huge tax increase on every single American in this country in the way of increased interest rates. So for a group of people who are just adamantly against tax increases, this is not something that they understand.

HOLMES: Right.

CARDONA: And that is something that the GOP is going to continue to have a problem with.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HOLMES: All right. So exactly what is it going to take to find a solution? Wolf Blitzer and Don Lemon they are breaking this all down for you, the hurdles, the options. You can check out "Get it Done: Countdown to Crisis" is coming your way Sunday Night, at 9:00 Eastern, right here on CNN.

And some other news now at six minutes past the hour: "New York Post" employees have been ordered to, quote, "Preserve and maintain documents related to possible phone hacking or bribery of public officials". Parent company News Corp has been bogged down in a phone- hacking and bribery scandal in Great Britain. CNN obtained a copy of the "New York Post" memos circulated yesterday, which suggest the scandal may be a concern in the U.S. as well.

Warren Jeffs, acting as his own attorney, causing a commotion in court. During testimony yesterday, he interrupted witnesses for the prosecution, saying God will bring sickness and death against people who prosecute his church. The polygamous sect leader is being tried on two counts of sexual assault of a child. You can hear what our legal guys have to say about this case next hour.

And there's a lot of disappointment in Texas after what was supposed to be tropical storm Don made landfall. It came ashore as a tropical depression, but it wasn't the rainmaker folks were hoping for.

CNN's Rob Marciano is in Corpus Christi for us.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ROB MARCIANO, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Well, here we are. The morning after the landfall of tropical storm Don and it's been a huge bust and disappointment all the way around. I've never been involved with a tropical cyclone where so many people onshore were cheering for it to gain strength, get together, and bring a lot of rain with it.

And Don did anything but that. Right now we have -- well, the sun's coming up, it's a beautiful day. The surf is still high, onshore winds and coastal flood advisory is the only thing that's still active as far as advisories go.

You know, in the TV business, when a tropical system makes landfall overnight and we're not live with it, we like to give what's called a tick-tock, meaning take slices of the evening and show you how it came ashore.

And embarrassingly, this is what we came up with.

MARCIANO: Check out the pocket radar here. This storm is dead. Radar, empty. Rain, nonexistent.

Well, there was dry air out ahead of this system, there were some wind shear, there are certainly with dry air over Texas, a lot of dry grounds as well, and this thing just completely evaporated when it hit the coastline.

Ironically, a lot of farmers have switched their crop to cotton this year because it's drought resistant and now the cotton is coming into harvest, and actually the farmers don't really want the rain right now, because they want to harvest that cotton. So they'll take a little bit later in the season.

So a little slice of good news there, but elsewhere in Texas, rainfall deficits well over a foot in many locales and this storm did not help.

Rob Marciano, CNN, Corpus Christi, Texas.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HOLMES: All right, at nine minutes past the hour, let me say good morning to Reynolds Wolf. It's -- an odd story. Strange to say, oh too bad that storm went away. But that was a different story down there.

REYNOLDS WOLF, AMS METEOROLOGIST: I know, I mean, when you think about it in recent history we had hurricane Della, we had Ike, we had Rita.

(CROSSTALK)

HOLMES: Yes.

WOLF: All these storms that hit the Texas coastline and the reaction was just the opposite. People were hoping that the storm would -- would divert and go to a different direction. In this situation, they were hoping for the storm to actually intensify, and maybe not bring heavy rain or heavy wind, but -- yes, definitely need some ample rainfall because of, of course, the incredible drought.

Well, unfortunately, that system is gone. But there is another one that is developing right now in the Atlantic. This one, this area you see shaded in this reddish box that is possibly Emily. Emily might be the name of this storm. We go from "D", we go to "E," Emily would be the next.

The National Hurricane Center giving this area of about of 70 percent chance of further development. So we're going to watch definitely very carefully over the next several days.

But again, this is back in time this is what happened with Don, just yesterday, looked very promising, and then, came onshore and then just fizzled out altogether. A few embedded storms down developing back over towards the big bend, but certainly not the major rain event that people were hoping for.

Rain may really be in the pick up across parts of the northern plains and into the arrowhead of Minnesota by late afternoon. Here is the reason why; because this front moving right across the U.S./Canadian border. That by late afternoon may give us some strong thunderstorms.

We'll talk more about that coming up. T.J., let's pitch it right back to you.

HOLMES: Reynolds, I appreciate you, buddy. We'll see you again here shortly.

Well, ten minutes past the hour now. There is yet another royal wedding in the UK that's happening today? But don't expect a lot of pomp and circumstance here, because the person getting married is the 13th in line to the throne.

Stay with me.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HOLMES: All right. 12 minutes past the hour now. I'll give you a look at some of the stories making international headlines.

The suspect in Norway's deadly bombing and shooting rampage told police he had plans to attack other targets, but investigators aren't revealing what those targets were.

Meanwhile, there have been dozens of memorial services to remember the 77 victims of last week's terror attacks. Several are going to be held in the coming days as well, and the first service was held in Oslo yesterday and was organized by the youth movement of the Labor Party.

Also, the severe flooding in South Korea is doing more than destroying homes, damaging crops and claiming dozens of lives. Military officials say the high waters are washing buried land mines from North Korea across the border. Soldiers with metal detectors have been called in to search for these explosives.

Also, DNA evidence is the focus of testimony today in the appeal for American college student Amanda Knox. Court-appointed experts said they have serious doubts about the evidence used to convict Knox of killing her British roommate. The police are defending accusations that they bungled the evidence.

Also, Queen Elizabeth's oldest granddaughter is getting married in Scotland today. Her name is Zara Phillips. She is saying the "I Dos" to her rugby player, Mike Tindall is his name. The 30-year-old Phillips is actually the 13th in line to the throne.

Well, despite the bad economy, the price for a lot of products are reaching all-time highs. You'd like to have a break, would you? Well, yes, there are actually items that are getting cheaper. If you're in the market for a new car, Volkswagen has lowered its prices.

Also, maybe you're not in the market for this, but if you're thinking about it, solar panels, is a good time to get those; they've dropped some 15 percent. And also, Netflix has dropped the price of their one DVD at a time service by $2.

But that's not all. Clyde Anderson, our financial analyst, has been doing some digging. We've got seven more things to tell you about right after the break that are getting cheaper.

It's 15 past the hour. Stay with me.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HOLMES: Well, it's 17 minutes past the hour now.

Americans starting to maybe get numb to rising prices, whether that's for gas, for food, or maybe just for that cup of coffee you had this morning. There are some things, though, that you can buy right now that are actually getting cheaper.

I talked to our financial analyst, Clyde Anderson, about this. He told me about seven things that are actually getting less expensive.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CLYDE ANDERSON, FINANCIAL ANALYST: Some of the things are in demand, some of the things aren't in demand right now. So one of the things we talked about, IKEA is actually reducing some of their prices.

HOLMES: Stuff already pretty cheap.

ANDERSON: Still pretty cheap --

HOLMES: I shouldn't say cheap, should I?

ANDERSON: Affordable. And that's the trend right now. That's what they do and that's the market that they're tapping into, because people are staying in their homes longer, so they want to remodel.

HOLMES: They want nice stuff in their homes.

This is one. Kind of a no-brainer here, but real estate.

ANDERSON: Real estate, yes. We've watched it come down in several markets. We always say real estate is local, so it really depends on your market. But also you can save $50,000 as compared to maybe a couple of years ago on some properties. I always say, people, America's on sale right now. So you need to tap into it.

HOLMES: America's on sale, yes. Who's about to buy us right now?

ANDERSON: Yes.

HOLMES: All right. Number three, the Amazon Kindle. We see the commercials for these all the time. They're getting cheaper and cheaper.

ANDERSON: And they're getting more popular. When it first came out in 2011, it came out at $399. You can buy one for about $114 now. They're going to have some that are going to roll out after Christmas, around $100.

And so it's really affordable. But that's technology. You know, technology is constantly changing and those prices are coming down and that's becoming more popular. So they don't have to charge as much as they did.

HOLMES: Does that appeal to a lot of people who don't want to go spend $700, $800 on an iPad?

ANDERSON: Exactly. A lot of people.

HOLMES: All right. Let's go to this now.

The 3D television -- this is going to be the next hot thing and it hasn't even taken off.

ANDERSON: It hasn't. It hasn't taken off at all. So you've seen them come down about $300 to $400 in price compared to a regular 2D television. And so that's coming down again. That's (INAUDIBLE) technology. Everybody thought it was going to boom and taken off, but it hasn't taken off as quickly as they would have liked it too.

HOLMES: We should probably keep waiting on this one though.

All right. Explain this one to me, though, the prepaid debit cards.

ANDERSON: Prepaid debit cards. This is interesting because what's happening is a lot of people have challenged credit right now.

Some people are unbanked or under-banked, or they don't trust banks or they just don't bank. And so they need to have debit cards because you think about it. You still want to be able to buy things online. You still want to be able to buy things over the phone, so you need that Visa logo, the MasterCard logo or whatever.

So a lot of people are getting into this market. American Express even launched a new one. And what they do is you load money on to the card and they just take it and use it as a debit card.

They charge you generally a monthly fee and a lot of these companies are reducing their monthly fee and their reload fee because that's where they make their money. If you add more money, they charge you a reload fee and when you use it they charge you a monthly kind of maintenance fee to have it.

HOLMES: You know -- and I have no idea here but how exorbitant are these fees? Are they small --

ANDERSON: Sometimes you're talking about $3 a month. Sometimes --

HOLMES: It's not much.

ANDERSON: -- the monthly and then to load it, about $3. Every time you want to put money on there. It just depends. When you're seeing some of those slash it and not even have that monthly fee just to really get customers.

HOLMES: OK. Last two here, and these are some bigger items, but pools. Swimming pools.

ANDERSON: Yes, definitely. A lot of people aren't going for the swimming pools anymore. We aren't seeing that, as popular as it has been. So what've done is cut them almost 75 percent for a swimming pool. Now, imagine that. I mean this may be the time for you to go and look into getting a swimming pool, you know.

HOLMES: Thank you, Clyde.

ANDERSON: That's a huge discount.

HOLMES: OK. Last one here, and we're kind of going off the reservation with this one, if you will, but space flight.

ANDERSON: Space flight, who knew? We're at the point now, when this first was introduced, a lot of people thought it was far-fetched. You know, when you go into space, you can travel into orbit; they were talking about almost $200,000 plus to do it.

HOLMES: Some of these commercial space travels.

ANDERSON: Yes. To go out there, go into orbit, and now they're talking about $100,000 that you'll be able to go into space for $100,000. And so some people are looking at this and already signing up to get their seats on these flights. So it is happening.

And so now you look at that. We see what happened with the Kindle over the last couple of years, maybe the same thing will happen with the space flights.

HOLMES: -- will happen with the flight.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

HOLMES: Space flight, book your seats now.

Well, what would you say if I told you Wal-Mart was about to expand. You might wonder, how could this giant get any bigger? Well, they could be about to change the way you watch movies at home. Those details next.

It's 21 past the hour. Stay with me on this CNN SATURDAY MORNING.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HOLMES: 24 minutes past the hour now.

Wal-Mart is getting into a new business, the movie business; allowing customers to download movies from their website.

Let's talk to our digital lifestyle expert, Mario Armstrong, about this. He told me that this could be a game-changer in the industry.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MARIO ARMSTRONG, DIGITAL LIFESTYLE EXPERT: What you're talking about is going on to Wal-Mart's site to be able to actually download the movie right then and there, so that you could watch it. You could stream that movie and watch it from your computer, from your laptop, you know, right in your own house.

HOLMES: OK, you need anything special here? Special equipment? You need a certain type of, you know -- I'll let you get into the technical stuff about how much speed you need on your computer and all that to be able to download these, but other than that, you don't need much, do you?

ARMSTRONG: You don't need much of anything, absolutely not. I mean all you need is really just a laptop or a computer, you need Internet connectivity, obviously. The higher the bandwidth with on that connectivity, obviously, the better to be able to really stream those movies and be able to not have what's called buffering and all that hiccupping that sometimes you experience on the web.

But, no, other than that, man, you really don't need anything else. They're not charging a subscription fee for their service. They're saying you can do this per rental. You can do $3.99 for a standard definition. If you want the high definition one, it's going to be about five to six bucks.

HOLMES: OK. Yes, bandwidth, I was going to say that, but I wanted you to have your moment there. Bandwidth, I knew that.

ARMSTRONG: You do know a few technical terms.

HOLMES: Well, tell us here, Wal-Mart, when you hear Wal-Mart is getting into the game, you better pay attention.

ARMSTRONG: Absolutely. Because, you know -- I don't want to call them mass consumerization, but we all know that once a product hits their shelves, it does reach mass consumers.

So with that being said, I think this could be a game changer in that for a long time, we've seen other companies in this space. We've seen Netflix, AppleTV, we've seen gaming consoles, Hulu, and all these other ways that you can get content over the web, but now for it to go into Wal-Mart, that's going to raise the attention for a lot of people that are going to say, wait, I can to this? It's not that hard for me to do. And can I stream these on my television instead of just watching it on my computer, because that's what I would really like to do.

And so I think it's going to bring a lot more attention and many more consumers to realize, hey, I could be experiencing entertainment in a different way.

Netflix is a little bit more -- is more expensive, but it all depends on what your usage is like. For example, Netflix also just announced that they were going to have some price hikes. Right now we're showing $7.99, but that may be changing. That may be going up to about $16 bucks. So we already know that there's a price hike that's happening. But it's unlimited rentals.

So if you know that you're going to rent you know three or five movies in a month then maybe that really is a good plan for you. It is a subscription-based plan, however, so you have to be aware of that.

Redbox, on the other hand, this are kiosks where you can actually go and pick up your DVD and you pay a buck for that. Now, that's different. That's not streaming. That's actually picking it up. But I do worry about that business and how they may be impacted by the convenience of someone like Wal-Mart stepping into this space, saying, hey, everybody, you can use your computers to watch movies right at home without leaving home.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

HOLMES: Could you imagine someone naming their child Cheeto? How about Orangeluo or what about Jermajesty? I did not just make those up. Yes, Jermajesty is the name of Jermaine Jackson's child. Now there are a lot of unique, if you will, names out there but they can actually have an impact on the child.

Coming up in a bit, I talk to the author of a book who's telling you what you should and should not name your child.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HOLMES: Well, at the bottom of the hour on this CNN SATURDAY MORNING, give you a look at some of the stories making headlines.

American student Amanda Knox is back in an Italian appeals court today, where a battle of DNA evidence is going on. Earlier this week, two court-appointed experts say crucial pieces of evidence used in her 2009 trial were mishandled.

But today, a police forensic examiner denied that. Knox is serving 26 years in prison for the murder of her British roommate, Meredith Kercher.

Well, family members and supporters of two American hikers detained in Iran rallied outside the country's mission to the United Nations today. They're calling for the release of Josh Fattal and Sean Bauer nearly two years after they were arrested by Iranian forces.

And the two men are scheduled to have a final hearing on espionage charges tomorrow. Meanwhile, Bauer's fiancee, Sarah Shourd, you saw her in the video, was released in September of 2010 after over 400 days in solitary confinement.

And the Muslim army private who authorities say admits to bomb a restaurant popular with Fort Hood army soldiers is being held without bond. Private First Class Naser Abdo is charged with possession of an unregistered destructive device.

He didn't help his case by refusing to stand when the judge entered the courtroom yesterday. Abdo later shouted an apparent reference to the Muslim soldier charged with a deadly shooting spree of Fort Hood back in 2009.

Also in Texas, they waited and they even prayed for a storm, but Tropical Storm Don was a big washout. It fizzled before making landfall, arriving as a tropical depression and the rain it was supposed to bring just did not happen. Parts of Texas are in a severe drought and the rain could have helped out a whole lot.

Turn now to Washington, D.C. you have heard it for a while now, months, that time is running out. Well, it really is right about now. They're trying to still make a debt deal.

The leaders of both House and Senate have floated their plans out there, but so far nothing has passed both Houses. The president is pressuring lawmakers to get on the same page.

CNN's Athena Jones at the White House for us.

Is the president doing that again today? He's been pressuring them in public statements and speeches and press conferences and even on Twitter, but is he on the phone pressuring them as well?

ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, yes, T.J. He's been using the White House's bully pulpit. We saw him on Monday night come out and put the pressure on, on Congress. He did it again on Friday and today also.

At the same time, despite the behind the scenes and in front of the camera stuff, behind the scenes, he's on the phone. Other people in the White House are on the phone.

A Democratic official has told CNN that the president and vice president has been in touch with members on the Hill in the last several days, trying to figure out a way to reach a compromise.

But he's keeping the pressure on in many ways and let's listen to what he had to say in this morning's weekly address about what would happen if Congress fails to reach a deal.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: That would be inexcusable and entirely self-inflicted by Washington. The power to solve this is in our hands. All that's needed is a simple vote that Democrats and Republicans have taken for decades including all of the leaders in Congress today. It was done 18 times under President Reagan, seven times under George W. Bush, and it must be done again now.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

JONES: Now, the president also made a point of saying that this vote to raise the debt ceiling is not a vote that allows Congress to spend more money. It's just a vote that allows the country to continue to pay the bills that are already coming due, bills that Congress have already racked up, T.J.

HOLMES: We saw so many meetings over the past several weeks. The president calling congressional leaders to the White House several times, but nothing like that at this point is planned for this weekend.

JONES: Not so far. There's nothing on the schedule. You know, we've seen these meetings of people coming into the cabinet room. We see a quick spray, a video spray, everyone talking. But all those meetings were unsuccessful, ultimately.

Now of course, people at the White House and people on the Hill, if they decide that another White House meeting is going to be necessary to have some sort of breakthrough or compromise on this deal, then, of course that meeting will happen. But as of right now, there's nothing on the schedule yet, T.J.

HOLMES: Nothing on the schedule. So I hate to do this what-if thing, this what-if scenario. So what if we get to Tuesday and there is no deal. Does the president have any other options?

JONES: Well, certainly if there's no deal on Tuesday, it's going to be uncharted territory in some way. You have the Treasury Department working with the Federal Reserve and the Office of Management and Budget on plans for how they'd handle paying bills, deciding who gets paid, who gets their checks, how to pay down the debt or address the debt, pay debt holders should we reach Tuesday without a deal.

But I'll tell you that the White House maintains that's not going to happen. As we get closer to Tuesday, we'll probably get to hear more details about what the treasury is planning. But the president says these two parties are not that far apart.

There's room for agreement. There are lots of different ways to resolve this problem, so let's get together and make it happen. We'll just have to see if that does happen, T.J.

HOLMES: All right, our Athena Jones, again, one of our newest members, I'll stop calling you that starting tomorrow, but one of the newest members here at CNN making her CNN SATURDAY MORNING debut. So good to see you. Welcome aboard, Athena. Thanks so much.

JONES: Thanks.

HOLMES: All right. So just what is going to have to happen to make this all get done? Well, "Get It Done: Countdown to A Debt Crisis" you can see that special with our Don Lemon and Wolf Blitzer tomorrow night, Sunday night 9:00 Eastern right here on CNN.

Also coming up this morning, we are having open tryouts for a new meteorologist here at CNN and our first applicant, you are seeing right there, what do you think? You'll see more from Fabio.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HOLMES: It's 39 minutes past the hour now.

Reynolds Wolf makes it look easy when he does the weather for you in the mornings. It's a job that a lot of people would like to have, because quite frankly, it looks fun, and it looks like something you have to have a good personality for. Maybe you could be a meteorologist. Well, not everyone can do it, can they, Fabio?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

FABIO, MODEL: This is a live look at Portland, Oregon. It's very sunny today and it feels so nice on Fabio's skin. Thank you, sun.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HOLMES: That's golden! How do you not like that? It's golden.

REYNOLDS WOLF, AMS METEOROLOGIST: It's absolutely fine. I mean, you know, he's got the guns. He's got the pastel shirt. He's got everything, the high cheekbones. I used to have hair like that. I did have hair like that.

HOLMES: When -- I didn't know you that era.

WOLF: When I was a roadie for the Grateful Dead, I did have hair like that.

HOLMES: This is Fabio. He was out having a little fun with one of the TV stations out in Oregon.

WOLF: He does a good job. The guy looks fantastic. He's 52 years old. He looks fantastic. I'm up with my Fabio knowledge. I'm a fan, what can I tell you? Great stuff. He had some easy weather to deal with in Portland. Weather's been kind of strange in other parts of the country, especially in Texas.

HOLMES: This thing is done, though?

WOLF: It's done, but now we have other things beginning to pop up now. That's the big story we have. We have another system, a potential system. This one would not be, of course, Don, we've gone from Ds to Es. The next one we'd be dealing with would be with possibly Emily.

Emily right out here in the Atlantic, you can see the convection, deep convection out there. About a 70 percent chance this could actually become a named storm. And if it does, well, it could veer off a bit more to the west-northwest, perhaps moving towards the Leeward Islands, Windward Islands.

It's still too early to say if it would affect the United States. It all bears watching, and of course, this time of the year, that's exactly what we're going to do here at CNN, your hurricane headquarters.

We're also the hurricane headquarters, of course, in the gulf. We're watching the situation there, what's left of don may bring a few spits and drizzles, but they were hoping for some really significant rainfall. That will not be in the cards.

Heavy rain will be a possibility up in the northern plains and in the western great lakes due to this area of low pressure, this frontal boundary moving off towards the east. By late afternoon will be your best chance of storms, some of those maybe severe by the late afternoon and in terms of your temperatures, again, just incredibly intense, 91, the expected high in Kansas City, 88 in Memphis, 87 in Chicago.

As warm as it has, still about 10 degrees shy from where it was about a week ago at this time. We were getting temperatures in the triple digits in spots like St. Louis, and with the high humidity, T.J., it felt much warmer. But a little bit of relief this weekend thankfully for millions of people.

HOLMES: There's something. All right, Reny, appreciate you, as always, buddy. Thank you so much.

It's about 18 minutes to the top of the hour now. Earlier, I showed you a couple of unusual baby names. Here's another one, we're not making this up, but Shannon Sossamon picked this name, Audio Science. It's pretty unique name I guess you could say.

But would you believe, in some countries, naming your child whatever you want is actually illegal. We'll explain that and also share with you some other unique baby names. Stay with me.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HOLMES: Well, about a quarter from the top of the hour now. We were looking at some unique, if you will, baby names before the break. Let me show you a few more.

And again, I have to tell you folks, we are not making these up. You see just a couple there. Dae'Moni is one of them. ESPN, I'm told that it's actually a pretty popular name. Now Congratulashyla and there's Ish in there.

Now I'm bringing all these to you for a reason because earlier I spoke to Rodney Kellum. He's the author, co-author of the book that's called "What Yo Nayme Iz?", and you see how that spelled there.

What not to name your child. He told me that many of these children end up going by initials or they legally change their names. But it's the children who keep these names who may actually end up suffering even professionally.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

RODNEY KELLUM, CO-AUTHOR, "WHAT YOU NAYME IZ?" When the regret comes in is when they join the workforce or attempt to join the workforce.

There's been a study back in 2003 of names where they did dummy resumes and used certain names on one side, certain names on the other side, and it showed a drastic drop in the percentage of responses to the resume, drastic.

To where it shows that there is a, maybe a bias that people don't even know that they have towards certain names.

HOLMES: Let me put up some more here. We were itching to share as many as we can. There's an Orangejello and Lemonjello.

KELLUM: Oranjello and they're twin brothers.

HOLMES: And that's Lemonjello and Oranjello and in Rainbow, I thought that was pretty creative. There's a Cheeto in there as well. Give me a couple that you have come across. We're sharing some here, but some that just blew your minds. Your favorites?

KELLUM: Well, my favorite isn't because it's so differently, but because it's differently spelled. The name, Quincy. You know, nothing too special about Quincy, right?

HOLMES: Wait, I'm trying to think how would you spell that.

KELLUM: They would spell it C-U-E for Cue, Y-E-N-C-I-E. So it's spelled Cueyencie, but it's Cueyencie.

HOLMES: But it's Cueyencie?

KELLUM: Right. So you imagine being an elementary teacher trying to get that right.

HOLMES: Do the parents in your research for your book, do they end up regretting it as well?

KELLUM: I think they probably see it from when the children grow up and get older and they start coming across these hindrances. I actually know a couple personally in the book and they're actually very successful people, lawyers, teachers, but it took a little bit of extra work on their part.

HOLMES: We also found, we were just describing, there are some countries that actually, they give you a list, essentially, if you will. They say, you can only pick from these names and they will only allow you -- what countries are we talking about that only allow you to use certain names and why do they have laws like that?

KELLUM: Iceland, Denmark, New Zealand. New Zealand just recently, I don't know if a lot of people read it, outlawed the name Lucifer, because several parents wanted to name their child Lucifer. But I think it's Iceland that has a list of 7,000 names period.

You can't go out of those names. They want to save the child embarrassment. They don't want you having a noble name of a noble family. So they say it in the way of, we're protecting your child from future bullying, future harassment and future embarrassment.

HOLMES: Has it gotten out of hand?

KELLUM: Over here?

HOLMES: Over here in this country?

KELLUM: I think so.

HOLMES: And people focus oftentimes, celebrities name their child this or that, so on and so forth, but it's not just celebrities. A lot of parents are doing this.

KELLUM: They want their child to be unique, but they're going about it the wrong way. It's to the detriment of the child.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

HOLMES: All right, Fredricka.

FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: Yes.

HOLMES: You have your legal guys on every day at noon Eastern Time. Can you sue your parents? Can you ask them that, can you sue your parents for what they name you?

WHITFIELD: For giving you a complicated name.

HOLMES: Is that what you want to go with? Unique is what we want to go with.

WHITFIELD: Well, what do I know? I should ask them. I'm not the legal expert, they are.

HOLMES: They say it can hurt you sometimes in the workforce.

WHITFIELD: Yes, I heard that. I'll ask the question, how about that.

HOLMES: Well, good morning to you, Fredricka. You look fabulous this morning, by the way.

WHITFIELD: That's so nice. Thank you. I'll be asking lots of questions to our legal guys as well. You remember on 9/11 the steel beams that were fused together --

HOLMES: Of course, of course.

WHITFIELD: -- and brought up, well, they've also been put into a memorial. Well, now there's at least one group that wants to contest this. They've filed suit in court saying it's inappropriate. Our legal guys will be talking about it and where this legal challenge goes.

HOLMES: Have they've given you any indication -- are there merits to it, I wonder?

WHITFIELD: That's one thing that will be explored, which is imposing religious beliefs on people. Is this a good argument? And this privately owned museum is being put into the New Jersey/New York ports authority, a public building therein lies part of their argument.

HOLMES: All right.

WHITFIELD: We're going to be talking about that and then also, remember last year people were given kind of an assignment around the world, cameras and a photography assignment of shooting a day in the life of -- a slice of a moment of their lives? Well, now it is a movie.

And it's called "Life in a Day" and it apparently is produced by Ridley Scott. Apparently, it is already getting rave reviews. It debuts in theaters across the world this weekend. And some people are saying, it is difficult to leave the theater.

It runs for like 24 hours long. You can sit there and watch it for 24 hours long or you can just pop in and out. Some people have already said it is difficult to part from it. It's already debuted in certain European nations.

HOLMES: If it's that good, it makes you want to sit there for 24 hours?

WHITFIELD: Yes, you want to see how people are just living and how these everyday moments are good enough to be in picture form on the silver screen. Isn't that interesting?

HOLMES: That was a great idea. I remember it happening at the time and wondering how it was all going to come together but 24 hours?

WHITFIELD: I know, so Josh Levs is going to be with us today to kind of reveal a little bit more about it. He's actually the one who told us about it last year. That there was this assignment Ridley Scott was giving ordinary people around the world. Isn't that cool?

HOLMES: I didn't know 24 hours in the theater?

WHITFIELD: Yes.

HOLMES: All right.

WHITFIELD: "Life in a Day," OK, and then Margaret Cho face to face, comedienne, actress, activist. We talk about everything under the sun. We talk about her activism. And we also talk about her kind of open marriage, my word, not hers, just based on the description, sounds like open marriage. She's married to a heterosexual man, but she is bisexual. We talk about that. She's very candid about that.

HOLMES: I'm hearing you right, open marriage. When I hear it, I think -- am I thinking the right thing?

WHITFIELD: Probably thinking, see other people and your spouse can, too. That's what they do and she talks about how that works.

HOLMES: OK.

WHITFIELD: It's very fascinating, very interesting.

HOLMES: I'll bet it is.

WHITFIELD: The conversation is. She also, you know, talks about --remember Tracy Morgan made those offensive remarks about gays. She and he are friends. They're colleagues.

They work together on "30 Rock." She talks about that situation and how a comedian pushes the limits. How it's expected to push the limits, but then how you don't want to cross the line and what happens when that does happen. Margaret Cho today, beginning noon Eastern Time face to face.

HOLMES: Did she say he crossed the line?

WHITFIELD: She said she would have handled it differently.

HOLMES: I'm always curious and you say, you've got to wait.

WHITFIELD: You want to hear her words, not mine.

HOLMES: OK, good to see you as always, Fredricka.

WHITFIELD: I'm just the conduit.

HOLMES: Well, we appreciate it. Thank you, noon time, seven minutes from now. Fredricka Whitfield coming your way. Always good to see you. Thank you so much.

All right, well, getting America's financial house in order, really?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. JOE WALSH (R), ILLINOIS: Thank God congressmen like me were here. Imagine, step back and imagine if the Republicans hadn't taken over Congress. This city would have raised the debt limit who knows how much.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HOLMES: But some of these guys on practicing what they preach when it comes to their finances. We'll tell you about their debts. Stay with me.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

HOLMES: To the top of the hour now, the House goes back to work to try to resolve the debt ceiling crisis that threatens to throw the U.S. into default.

We'll go live to Capitol Hill and when it comes to debt, some hardliners in this debate are not practicing what they preach. Here now, CNN's Brian Todd.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They're the fire brand class, deficit hawks in Congress taking a hard line on the debt ceiling talks. Some are Tea Party favorites who rail at Congress for past spending like Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah.

SEN. MIKE LEE (R), UTAH: Congress that for decades, it's been burying our children and grandchildren, both born and unborn under a mountain of debt.

TODD: But according to recent disclosure forms, Senator Lee's racked up significant personal debt of his own, at least $65,000 worth from a credit card and a line of credit.

The forms, released last month, show there are a few Republicans who are demanding a hard line on cutting the nation's debt but have plenty of debt on their own, nonpartisan spending watchdog, Taxpayers for Common Sense.

RYAN ALEXANDER, TAXPAYERS FOR COMMON SENSE: I think this raises questions about, are you walking the walk while you're talking the talk about getting the debt down.

TODD: Senator's Lee's argument, you have to put this in context. An aide said the senator couldn't do an interview with us. But the aide said the scrutiny is, quote, "crackpot."

(on camera): The aide says the senate has his finances in order. He's managing his debt responsibly and that if he's doing that, who are the critics to question his role in the budget debate.

(voice-over): Tea Party supported Republican Congressman Joe Walsh has played a prominent role in that debate.

REP. JOE WALSH (R), ILLINOIS: Thank God congressmen like me were here. Imagine step back and imagine if the Republicans hadn't taken over Congress. This city would have raised the debt limit who knows how much.

TODD: But Walsh's ex-wife says he has more than $117,000 in child support, according to a lawsuit. We couldn't reach Walsh's attorney for comment. But he told the "Chicago Sun Times" Walsh doesn't owe that amount. Walsh says the attacks against him in this case are false, but also says this --

WALSH: I'm the most openly vetted candidate in the world. I have had financial troubles and I talked about them throughout the campaign. This is where real America is.

TODD (on camera): There's no evidence that there's any financial impropriety. What's wrong with them incurring debt that millions of other do?

ALEXANDER: They're allowed to incur debt just like millions of other Americans do, but we're also allowed to push back and ask questions about if you choose to incur personal debt, if that's how you choose to manage your finances, how can you tell the country we can't manage our own debt?

TODD (voice-over): The document say two other Republican congressmen, Tim Griffin of Arkansas who recently said America has a spending addiction and Kevin Yoder of Kansas who said Washington needs to cut up the credit cards, each had credit card debt of at least $15,000 as of late last year.

We contacted the offices of both congressmen. They didn't respond.

Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

HOLMES: I don't know what to say on that one. I don't know. Everybody has their financial issues, I guess. We've all had them.

WHITFIELD: Everyone has.

HOLMES: Everyone has, but as I hand it over to you here and we try to get past that one --

WHITFIELD: I guess so.

HOLMES: What have you got? You're going to D.C.?

WHITFIELD: We are going to D.C. at the top. All that's taking place, all the action is on Capitol Hill and then maybe on to the White House, too.

HOLMES: It's all yours.

Clash raged not over groceries, but over labor, environment

KAIVAN MANGOURI'S July 22 front-page article "Wal-Mart to enter local grocery wars" devotes much attention to whether the retail giant's increased presence in the Boston area will improve consumer choice. Only in the last sentence does Mangouri hint at the "community opposition" that has kept Wal-Mart from gaining a share of urban markets.

The real war that Wal-Mart is waging is not against other groceries, but against American labor and against the environment. And the community opposition it faces comes from Wal-Mart's record, which includes discriminatory labor practices and violations of clean water legislation.

Somerville mayor's line in the sand

is a curious step

IT IS difficult to decide whether to laugh or cry at Mayor Joseph Curtatone's opening salvo directed at Wal-Mart's plan to open a grocery store in Somerville ("No red carpet for Wal-Mart Market," Business, July 23).

If it wasn't for the horror of his apparent desire to kill dozens of potential jobs waiting to be created in what is now an empty eyesore, I would be chuckling at the fact that he was taking this tough stand while off on vacation.

Attorneys for Wal-Mart and women suing the retail giant for discrimination returned to court Friday for the first time since a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling.

The two sides discussed how long to give women to sue the company if they hadn't already filed a lawsuit.

Women who say Wal-Mart Stores Inc. denied them pay raises and promotions because of gender bias are regrouping after the Supreme Court dismantled a class of up to 1.5 million current and former Wal-Mart workers last month.

Had the class-action lawsuit gone forward, Wal-Mart could have been liable for billions of dollars in back pay and other damages. The high court concluded that the group did not have enough in common to band together to sue the company.

Plaintiff lawyers want to bring multiple, narrower class-action claims against the retailer, while Wal-Mart wants each case to be litigated individually.

At a hearing on Friday in a San Francisco federal court, plaintiff attorney Joseph Sellers argued for a January deadline for women who filed complaints against Wal-Mart with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but who had not yet sued.

Wal-Mart attorney Theodore Boutrous argued for an October deadline.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer did not rule from the bench, but indicated he was leaning toward Wal-Mart's timeline.

No red carpet for Walmart Market ; Grocery store faces obstacles in Somerville

Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s plan to open its first grocery-only market in the Northeast in Somerville is already running into a roadblock, as the city's mayor is raising questions about the retail giant's employee practices.

Joseph Curtatone said in a statement yesterday that he has "deep concerns about Wal-Mart's labor policies that must be addressed before we can support them moving into our community."

Curtatone has leverage: The company needs a zoning permit to operate at its target location on Mystic Avenue, near the Assembly Square shopping plaza. The site, which previously housed the defunct retailer Circuit City, has a zoning permit to sell electronics, and Wal-Mart would have to go before a Somerville planning board to receive a special permit to sell food, according to city spokesman Michael Meehan.

Wal-Mart expects to soon sign a lease for the former Circuit City building, located in densely packed district of commercial plazas, for its first local Walmart Market, a medium-sized grocery store that is part of the company's strategy to increase its presence in urban areas by opening smaller outlets. The Walmart Market would be about 34,000 square feet, less than half the size of a typical Walmart box store.

Wal-Mart spokesman Steven Restivo said the company comes up against similar objections across the country and doesn't see the zoning permit as problem.

"I would say that what we're finding in Massachusetts and across the country is that the more people get to know the facts about the company the more they see the value in bringing a Walmart to their community," he said.

Meehan said Curtatone is on vacation and not available for further comment on Wal-Mart's labor practices. But community activists have long targeted the Arkansas retailer, complaining it pays employees poorly, offers too little in the way of benefits, and fights workers' efforts to air grievances.

A group of female employees has sued the company, alleging it discriminated against women by paying them less than it pays men in comparable jobs and offering them fewer opportunities for promotion. The US Supreme Court recently rejected the plaintiffs' request to have their complaints combined into a nationwide class-action suit, so the women said they would pursue their claims in lower courts.

Russ Davis, executive director of Massachusetts Jobs With Justice, is organizing opposition to Wal-Mart openings in the state, hoping to pressure the company into improving its compensation practices. Wal-Mart's goal, Davis said, "is to make as much money as it can and it does that by squeezing workers and suppliers."

But spokesman Restivo contended Wal-Mart's wages and benefits at its Massachusetts stores are comparable to competitors, with an average wage of nonmanagement employees of $13.18 an hour. It has 49 stores in Massachusetts employing nearly 12,000 people.

In Somerville, Wal-Mart could be in for a fight, depending on how deeply Curtatone digs in. Getting a zoning permit can take months, or depending on the opposition, years, Meehan said.

Meehan said the city planning board has rejected requests for special permits, and added that the applicant's reputation and practices as an employer may factor into the city's decision.

For example, the planning board rejected Ocean State Job Lot's request to open a store at a vacant building in Winter Hill last year because officials did not like the image the discount retailer projects. Having a Job Lot there, the board said, would "limit the ability to bring new amenities to the Winter Hill neighborhood." Somerville was subsequently sued by the property owner and Ocean State Job Lot officials said they did not feel welcome by the mayor.

BENTONVILLE, Ark. — A federal judge said Friday he will decide in a few days whether to extend a filing deadline 90 days or 120 days on a gender bias suit against Wal-Mart Stores  here.

Attorneys for the plaintaiffs — a group of women seeking to sue Wal-Mart on the basis of gender bias — want the filing deadline extended until Jan. 16; Theorore Boutrous, Wal-Mart's attoney, said he would be OK with extending the filing till Oct. 20. He said the company is not opposed to "start the clock fresh" on this and other potential gender-bias claims that were blocked from being filed while Wal-Mart challenged the legality of a class-action lawsuit filed in 2001.

That suit — filed on behalf of more than one million workers — was rejected last month by the U.S. Supreme Court, which said the plaintiffs failed to prove Wal-Mart had a nationwide policy that led to gender discrimination.

Wal-Mart to give sales data to Nielsen; Industry players can get more “realistic” market-share picture

NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — In a move that’s expected to fill an information gap in the industry, Walmart U.S., the biggest unit of the world’s largest retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc., will release some of its sales data to research firm Nielsen Co. for the first time in more than a decade.

The Bentonville, Ark.-based company’s Sam’s Club wholesale-membership chain already provides information to Nielsen, the data research and analytics firm said, declining to outline the terms of the agreement.

Walmart (WMT, US) will provide sales data in the grocery, consumables and over-the-counter drug categories, company spokeswoman Tara Raddohl said. Those categories represent the bulk of the approximately $260 billion in sales for Walmart U.S.

“This expanded relationship with Nielsen will provide Walmart and Sam’s Club with deeper insights into customer purchasing — and unmet needs — both nationally and in key local markets,” said Cindy Davis, head of Walmart global customer insights, in a statement from Nielsen. “We plan to share our point-of-sale information to help us identify category-growth opportunities sooner and collaborate with our manufacturer partners.”

The announcement came as the retail giant’s U.S. unit is seeking to reserve eight straight quarters of negative same-store sales, hurt in part by prior decisions to take products such as plus-sized apparel or hunting gear off shelves. Wal-Mart also has been hurt by the slow U.S. job growth and inflation in gasoline and food costs that have further limited its lower-income shoppers’ ability to spend.

Earlier this year, the company named Davis, who was an executive at Sam’s Club, to the newly created global customer-insights team to better study trends and consumer needs and wants. Sam’s Club has outperformed its larger chain as it rolled out initiatives such as the eValues program, which gives customers discounts based on their shopping patterns.

The participation from Walmart U.S. also will help the retail industry — from rivals Target Corp. (TGT, US) and Dollar General Corp. (DG, US)  to suppliers like Procter & Gamble Co. (PG, US) and Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT, US) — to better understand how consumers spend their money in an environment where they’re increasingly discriminating, analysts said.

Schaumburg, Ill.-based Nielsen already receives data from the majority of U.S. food, drug, discount, convenience and dollar-store chains, and counts those retailers and their suppliers as customers.

“It’s going to help everybody get a realistic picture of their market share,” said John Long, a retail strategist at consulting firm Kurt Salmon. “It’s going to help Walmart understand where it has opportunities. The addition of Walmart will be meaningful.”

If one message leaps out from this past term, it is that the U.S. Supreme Court's five justice majority greatly dislikes class and aggregate litigation. This message came through loud and clear both in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes,1 in which the Court made class certification virtually impossible in any Title VII class action for money damages and in AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion,2 in which the Court found that the Federal Arbitration Act preempted California's attempt to mandate class-wide arbitration in standard form retail contracts.

But nowhere is it clearer than in Janus Capital Group Inc. v. First Derivative Traders,3 in which the same five justice majority selectively combs dictionaries to give the narrowest possible construction to the term "maker" for purposes of Rule 10b-5. The net result was that an investment adviser who controlled a mutual fund and drafted its public statements could not be held liable for knowing misrepresentations.

Still, as this column will suggest, the result in Janus Capital may be narrower than it first appears and may differ only marginally from existing law (at least from the existing "attributed statement" rule in the Second Circuit). More importantly, if the Securities and Exchange Commission truly wanted to nullify the impact of Janus Capital, it could do so easily (at least within the context of mutual funds).

In fairness, the Court did not uniformly seek this term to curb class action litigation. For example, the Court stayed well within the mainstream, following established precedent, in both Matrixx Initiatives Inc. v. Siracusano,4 and Erica P. John Fund Inc. v. Halliburton Co.,5 It declined to use these opportunities to narrow Rule 10b-5's core concept of materiality or to require plaintiffs to prove loss causation at class certification. This pragmatic caution contrasts sharply with the majority's more ideological approach in Wal-Mart, Concepcion and Janus Capital.

What explains this contrast? Most likely, it was the majority's deference to stare decisis. Possibly, they understand that, if they rush to overturn well-established precedents (such as, most notably, Basic Inc. v. Levinson6), they can expect a future liberal majority to reverse their own decisions. Still, even if the Court is thus unlikely to reverse Basic, language in Wal-Mart suggests that its presumption of reliance may still be rebutted at trial in ways that could yet make a securities class action unmanageable. Basic may survive in theory, but could die a death of a thousand cuts.

This column will principally assess the impact of Janus Capital and evaluate what the SEC could do in response (if the SEC in a marked change of attitude were willing to take corrective action). Finally, it will take notice of the implications of Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc.,7 a First Amendment decision this June in which the Court narrows the commercial speech doctrine to the point that the SEC must anticipate future challenges to its authority to mandate corporate disclosures in proxy contests and related contexts.

'Janus Capital'

The key issue in Janus Capital was the meaning of the term "maker," given Rule 10b-5's language, which forbids "any person...[t]o make any untrue statement of a material fact" in connection with a purchase or sale of a security. The SEC had argued in its amicus brief that "to make" meant "to create," and those who drafted the prospectus therefore "created" it and thus were "makers." The majority, in a decision by Justice Clarence Thomas, rejected the SEC's definition:

For purposes of Rule 10b-5, the maker of a statement is the person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement, including its content and whether and how to communicate it. Without control, a person or entity can merely suggest what to say, not "make" a statement in its own right.8

As the majority further explained, even a ghostwriter who drafts the entire document is not a "maker" where it lacks control.

At first glance, this seems very sweeping and might be read to overrule even the Second Circuit's strict "attributed statement" rule. Under that rule, a secondary actor cannot incur primary liability under Rule 10b-5 for a statement not attributed to the actor at the time of its dissemination. 9 Suppose then that a Form 10-K includes the fraudulent statement of a mining engineer in which he knowingly and materially overstates the ore in the issuer's principal mine. This would be an attributed statement, but the mining engineer does not possess "ultimate authority" over the filing of the Form 10-K and cannot seemingly control "whether and how to communicate" his statement in the above language.

Is this mining engineer now immune from Rule 10b-5 liability? Probably not! Two sentences after the above quotation, Justice Thomas deals with precisely this case:

[I]n the ordinary case, attribution within a statement or implicit from surrounding circumstances is strong evidence that a statement is made by, and only by, the party to whom it is attributed.10

This is actually more liberal than the existing Second Circuit "attributed statement" rule because it expressly allows for attribution that is "implicit from surrounding circumstances." But curiously, Justice Thomas seems to suggest that the attributed statement creates liability "only" for the person quoted and not the issuer that may knowingly incorporate his false statement.

The Second Circuit has sometimes deviated from its strict attribution rule in cases involving senior executives of the corporation and not required an explicit "attribution" in their case as a precondition to liability.11 Suppose then that, after Janus Capital, a CEO is sued because of a materially misleading corporate press release that does not mention him or attribute any statement to him. Although the old Second Circuit cases have become irrelevant, the same issue again arises on one of two possible bases: (1) There may have been an implicit attribution to the CEO under Janus Capital, or (2) The CEO might be asserted to possess the "ultimate authority over the statement."12

Of course, this CEO can also be sued as a "controlling person" under Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, but the CEO then would acquire additional affirmative defenses under that section. From a legal purist's standpoint, Justice Thomas's equation of "maker" with "control" seems to violate the usual rules of statutory construction, because Section 20(a) already expressly created liability for the control person. When maker is defined to mean those in control, there is duplication. But that is now water over the dam.

Much of the commentary about Janus Capital has claimed that it will force mutual fund investors to "sue themselves" (i.e., the mutual fund) because they can no longer sue their investment advisor. That may overstate and probably misunderstands the unique factual posture of Janus Capital. That action was not a suit by mutual fund investors against their investment advisor, but rather a suit by shareholders in the investment advisor against the investment advisor. The investment advisor's stock had dropped sharply after it was disclosed that it had been permitting some investors to engage in dubious market timing practices at its mutual fund, despite statements in the mutual fund's prospectus that it would resist and discourage market timing by investors.

Because the shareholders in the parent company (Janus Capital Group (JCG)) had not purchased shares in the mutual fund (Janus Investment Fund (JIF)), they had no cause of action under Sections 11 or 12 of the Securities Act of 1933 and had to rely on Rule 10b-5.

Their theory before the Court was that the misstatements in the JIF prospectus had been created or "made" by Janus Capital Management LLC (JCM), which was the actual investment adviser to JIF and a wholly owned subsidiary of JCG. Plaintiffs asserted that JCM was the "maker" and they could sue JCG as its "controlling person" under Section 20(a) because they had relied on the statements in the JIF prospectus, which were allegedly made by JCM, in buying shares of JCG. That is a Rube Goldberg theory of liability, and the Court's short answer was that if JCM was not a "maker" (because it did not have "ultimate authority" over JIF's prospectus), then JCG had no derivative liability as a controlling person, because the controlled person had no liability.

Here, plaintiffs may have made a tactical error? If they had instead asserted that JIF was the "maker" of the allegedly false statements in its own prospectus, they could have asserted that JCM and JCG had derivative liability under Section 20(a) as its controlling persons. To be sure, JIF's board had a majority of independent directors, but "control" under well-established SEC rules and precedents is a question of fact and depends on "the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to cause the direction of the management and policies of a person."13

Factually, it should not have been difficult to establish that the actual management of JIF was in the hands of its management and its investment adviser, not its independent directors; in fact, the officers of JIF (and some of its directors) were also officers of JCM and/or JCG. Arguably, some of them must have known that market timing was occurring. Under this theory, there would have no issue about who the "maker" was (i.e., JIF), but only about whether JCM or JCG controlled JIF for purposes of Section 20(a).

The one limitation on this theory is that it might sometimes be difficult to prove that the mutual fund had knowledge of the material omission or misrepresentation. Under Section 20(a), if the mutual fund lacks scienter, then the controlling person escapes liability because the controlling person is only "liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such controlled person." On the facts of Janus Capital, the mutual fund's officers had the same knowledge (and scienter) as the investment adviser's (because they were the same people).

But this may not always be the case. So, what should be done to correct this problem, where it can be credibly asserted that the mutual fund was innocent of knowledge? The simplest answer might be for the SEC to require the investment adviser (and its most senior officers) to sign the mutual fund's prospectus (and also any Form 10-K or Form 10-Q that it is required to file). This signature could be accompanied by a legend that in signing this document, "each of the undersigned acknowledge and agree that they are co-makers of the statements contained therein." This would not establish scienter (which would need to be separately proven), but it would outflank the Court's new formalistic insistence that the investment adviser is not the maker of the statements that it crafts.

Although the mutual fund industry would likely challenge the SEC's authority to require investment advisers to sign the mutual fund's registration statement and 1934 Act filings, the SEC has previously asserted its authority to compel outside directors to sign the Form 10-K. The real issue here is less the SEC's authority than its willingness to confront the industry. Of all SEC Divisions, the Division of Investment Management has been the most acquiescent and roundheeled with respect to those it is suppose to regulate. While other Divisions missed Bernie Madoff's fraud (possibly because they also were too deferential to industry leaders), the Division of Investment Management was actually aware of the market timing scandal, and did nothing until Eliot Spitzer took action. That strongly suggests regulatory capture.

'Wal-Mart'

On its face, Wal-Mart does little to affect securities class actions. Although it has breathed a new life into the previously hollow "commonality" requirement of Rule 23(a), this requirement will still easily be satisfied in securities fraud cases where the "common" issue will typically be either (1) the materiality of defendant's omission or misrepresentation or (2) whether the defendant acted with scienter.

Still, buried in a footnote in Wal-Mart, the majority does say something significant that could cloud the future of securities class actions. After class certification, the Wal-Mart majority states, the plaintiff "will surely have to prove again at trial [that the market was efficient] in order to make out their case on the merits."14 Assume now that at class certification, the trial court finds the market to be efficient and announces its intent to certify the class. But the defendant next demands the right to rebut at trial that presumption, based on Wal-Mart, by showing that one large group of class members, i.e., indexed investors, did not rely on the market to establish accurate prices, but were rather indifferent to pricing accuracy because they invested in the entire market. This would be hard to prove (investors could simply testify that they did rely on the market price), but defendant's real goal may not be to convince the jury, but rather to persuade the court that the class action is unmanageable.

The issue then is what the defendant can seek to show at trial. Is it limited to seeking to rebut market efficiency before the jury? Or, does it have a Seventh Amendment right to seek to disprove individual reliance by showing that at least some class members never relied on the accuracy of the market price?

Wal-Mart does not suggest the answer, but it does suggest that this issue can arise again, and without the Court being required to overrule Basic v. Levinson. Indeed, Wal-Mart also implies that a trial court probably cannot use a sampling procedure to resolve this issue judicially, but must let the matter go to the jury.

What is the most sensible route out of this quandary? Here, a defendant's weapon might be turned on its head to serve plaintiffs. Let us assume that defendants broadly plead as an affirmative defense that many class members did not rely on the accuracy of the market price. This is easily asserted, but less easily proven, and is essentially plead as a diversionary tactic to make the action unmanageable. Absent more specific pleading, the trial court should be entitled to disregard such a defense as implausible under Ashcroft v. Igbal.15 Those who live by the Twombly/Igbal sword may on occasion also perish by it.

'Sorrell v. IMF Health'

No one at the SEC may have yet recognized it, but the Court's decision last month in Sorrell v. IMF Health16 is likely to significantly complicate the SECs ability to require certain corporate disclosures that effectively mandate corporate speech.

The decision invalidated on First Amendment grounds a Vermont statute that precluded the sale of prescriber-identifying information by pharmacies and drug stores, or the disclosure of such information, to pharmaceutical companies for marketing purposes. The intent was to protect privacy, and this context seems remote from that of corporate speech in proxy statements and prospectuses. But in reaching its decision, the majority reshaped the commercial speech doctrine to require a higher standard of justification when a law enacts content-based or speaker-based restrictions. As the dissent noted, that is what many regulatory agencies do on a regular basis.17

As Justice Stephen Breyer pointed out, the "Federal Reserve Board regulates the content of statements, advertising, loan proposals, and interest rate disclosures, but only when made by financial institutions."18 Justice Breyer did not mention the SEC, but it in particular restricts speech on the basis of content and distinguishes among speakers selectively.

To take a current example, SEC Rule 14a-11, which would grant shareholders "access to the proxy statement," requires a public corporation soliciting proxies to include the names of certain shareholder nominees for the board. Such a rule arguably discriminates among speakers and is content-based. To be sure, Rule 14a-11 is already under attack before the D.C. Circuit and may be struck down on other grounds, but eventually the SEC could perform the requisite cost/benefit analysis and reinstate it, unless it were found to violate the First Amendment. After Sorrell, that possibility is at least conceivable.

Conclusion

Janus Capital will be cited and asserted as a defense in any number of securities class actions. But in the Second Circuit, it probably does not go much beyond the "attributed statement" rule and may even stop short of it. In the context of mutual funds, the SEC could curb its reach by requiring the investment adviser to sign the mutual fund's registration statement and its 1934 Act filings. Alternatively, plaintiffs can assert that the investment adviser "controlled" the fund for purposes of Section 20(a), which analysis seems generally correct when there is an overlap of officers between the fund and the investment adviser.

Finally, Wal-Mart reminds us that when a securities class goes to trial (or even seriously approaches that point) there are still unexplored issues about how the "fraud on the market" presumption applies at trial.

* Plaintiffs want case broken into smaller class actions

* Workers in bias case request more time to file claims

* Wal-Mart says cases should be filed individually

By Moira Herbst

NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Plaintiffs in a huge sex bias class-action case against Wal-Mart Stores Inc that was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court will begin to unveil plans on Friday for how they will try to resuscitate their lawsuits.

Lawyers for the women will argue in U.S. District Court in San Francisco that they should be able to press ahead with multiple, narrower class-action claims against the retailer.

Wal-Mart, however, wants to make sure any potential class actions are kept firmly in the grave.

Women who say the company denied them pay raises and promotions because of gender bias are regrouping after the Supreme Court dismantled a class of up to 1.5 million current and former Wal-Mart workers last month.

Had the class-action lawsuit gone forward, Wal-Mart could have been liable for billions of dollars in back pay and other damages. The court concluded that the group did not have enough in common to band together to sue the company.

Friday's hearing marks the first time both sides have appeared in court following the landmark decision.

Since the case cannot move forward as one massive case, plaintiffs must reformulate claims into more tailored groups -- or as individual lawsuits.

Joseph Sellers, a lead attorney for the plaintiffs and a partner at law firm Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll in Washington, said plaintiffs will propose a smaller class-action lawsuit in California, and could bring similar cases elsewhere in the country. He declined to comment before the hearing on how many smaller class-action lawsuits there could be.

"There was this sense after the Supreme Court decision that the case was dead, and we dispute that," Sellers said.

"We think the decision leaves open the possibility of bringing more narrowly tailored class actions."

Plaintiffs could carve up the larger group of current and former Wal-Mart workers according to different stores or regions, and different job descriptions and time frames of employment. It is unclear what Wal-Mart's potential liabilities could be in this scenario if it loses the case.

Sellers said hundreds of attorneys have contacted his firm expressing interest in representing plaintiffs in revised litigation. His firm spent about $7 million on the original lawsuit against Wal-Mart that landed at the Supreme Court, and so far has not seen a return on its investment. [ID:nN1E75K1P7]

REQUEST FOR MORE TIME

The Supreme Court did not rule on the merits of the plaintiffs' bias claims, only whether they could link together to sue. The ruling has been applauded by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business group but denounced by women's organizations.

Wal-Mart has said that the ruling means that current or former workers wishing to sue for sex discrimination would have to do so on an individual basis -- not through a series of smaller class actions.

"We strongly believe the Supreme Court's decision forecloses any reconfigured class," said Theodore Boutrous, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in Los Angeles and lead attorney for Wal-Mart.

At Friday's hearing, the plaintiffs will also argue that current and former Wal-Mart workers need more time to file discrimination claims with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or new lawsuits against the company before the statute of limitations runs out.

In a court filing last month, Sellers asked that the court give former members of the dismissed class an additional four months to file new EEOC claims or litigation. Wal-Mart opposes granting the extra time.

The Wal-Mart ruling is expected to have widespread impact on many types of class-action lawsuits, making it more difficult to win certification of large groups of plaintiffs.

On July 18, a Michigan state court cited the decision when it decertified a class of more than 3,000 property owners suing Dow Chemical Co .

Pending sex-discrimination class actions that could be impacted by the Wal-Mart ruling include cases against Costco Wholesale Corp , Toshiba Corp , Goldman Sachs Group Inc , Cigna Corp and Bayer .

The case is Betty Dukes et al v Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Case no. 01-cv-02252.

Class Of 1.5 Million Female Wal-Mart Employees Was Improperly Certified

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. ___, 2011 WL 2437013 (2011)

The United States Supreme Court held that this class of as many as 1.5 million current and former female Wal-Mart employees was improperly certified by the lower court. The three lead plaintiffs claimed they were discriminated against on the basis of their gender and that Wal-Mart's policy of providing deference to local managers' subjective pay and promotion decisions satisfied the commonality test for certifying a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, punitive damages and backpay for the class members. In a 5-to-4 majority opinion, the Court rejected plaintiffs' showing of commonality, including the fact that they submitted only 120 affidavits (one for every 12,500 class members) purportedly evidencing gender discrimination. In the second part of the opinion, the Court unanimously held that plaintiffs' claims for backpay were improperly certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) because the monetary relief was not incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief sought.

Arizona Law Requiring Use Of E-Verify Is Upheld

Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting, 563 U.S. ___, 131 S. Ct. 1968 (2011)

In 1996, Congress created E-Verify, which is "an internet-based system that allows an employer to verify an employee's work-authorization status." In 2007, Arizona enacted the Legal Arizona Workers Act, which allows Arizona to suspend or revoke the licenses necessary to do business in the state if an employer knowingly or intentionally employs an unauthorized alien. Among other things, the Arizona law also requires that "every employer, after hiring an employee, shall verify the employment eligibility of the employee" by using E-Verify. In this case, the Chamber of Commerce challenged the Arizona law on the ground that it is expressly and impliedly preempted by federal immigration law, but the Supreme Court rejected those claims, upholding the statute.

U.S. Court Has Jurisdiction Over Argentinean Employees' Claims Against Mercedes-Benz Argentina

Bauman v. Daimler Chrysler Corp., 2011 WL 1879210 (9th Cir. 2011)

In this case, 22 Argentinian residents (including a Chilean national) sued DaimlerChrysler Aktiengesellschaft ("DCAG") in federal court in California, alleging that one of DCAG's subsidiaries, Mercedes-Benz Argentina ("MBA"), collaborated with state security forces to kidnap, detain, torture and kill plaintiffs and their relatives during Argentina's "Dirty War" in the 1970s. (Some of the plaintiffs are former employees of MBA.) In an opinion by Judge Reinhardt, the Ninth Circuit held that the district court has personal jurisdiction in California over DCAG through the contacts of its subsidiary and agent, Mercedes-Benz USA, in view of the "interest of California in adjudicating important questions of human rights...." See also McCollum v. California Dep't of Corrections and Rehabilitation, 2011 WL 2138221 (9th Cir. 2011) (court has no jurisdiction over Wiccan chaplain's claim that he should be eligible for employment in the paid-chaplaincy program).

Employee Was Not Sexually Harassed By His Male Supervisor, But Could Proceed With Retaliation Claim

Kelley v. The Conco Cos., 196 Cal. App. 4th 191 (2011)

Patrick Kelley, an apprentice ironworker, complained to his employer, Conco, that he had been subjected to a "barrage of sexually demeaning comments and gestures by his male supervisor" (David Seamen). After Kelley's union suspended him from its apprenticeship program, he was not rehired by Conco. Kelley sued for sexual harassment and retaliation in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act. The trial court granted summary judgment to the employer, but the Court of Appeal reversed the dismissal of Kelley's claim of retaliation. However, with respect to the claim of sexual harassment, the Court affirmed dismissal: "Unquestionably, the language used by both Seaman and by one of Kelley's coworkers... was graphic, vulgar, and sexually explicit. The literal statements expressed sexual interest and solicited sexual activity. There was however, 'no credible evidence that the harasser was homosexual' or that the harassment was 'motivated by sexual desire.'" The Court further held that Kelley had failed to establish he was subjected to harassment that was so severe and pervasive as to alter the conditions of his employment or that he suffered severe emotional distress as a result of Seaman's conduct. With respect to the retaliation claim, the Court held that Kelley's evidence established a clear inference that he was subjected to retaliation by at least some of his coworkers as a result of his complaints about Seaman.

ADA "Impliedly Amended" The National Bank Act's Termination-at-Pleasure Clause

Quinn v. U.S. Bank, N.A., 196 Cal. App. 4th 168 (2011)

Robert Quinn, a former senior vice president of U.S. Bank, alleged he was denied accommodation, harassed and terminated because of a physical disability in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act. U.S. Bank obtained summary judgment from the trial court on the ground that Quinn's FEHA claims were preempted by the dismissal-at-pleasure clause of the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. § 24. The Court of Appeal determined that the "seminal California case" on the subject, Peatros v. Bank of America, 22 Cal. 4th 147 (2000), is not "binding precedent" because the lead opinion was a plurality, not a majority opinion. Consequently, the Court held that "to the extent FEHA is not inconsistent with section 24 as impliedly amended by the ADA, it is not preempted" and, therefore, FEHA's longer statute of limitations applies, but Quinn's claims against his supervisor are preempted because there is no individual supervisor liability under the ADA. See also People ex rel. Harris v. Pac Anchor Transp., Inc., 195 Cal. App. 4th 765 (2011) (California's Unfair Competition Law is not preempted by the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act).

Auto Sales Consultants' Class Action Was Properly Dismissed

Areso v. CarMax, Inc., 195 Cal. App. 4th 996 (2011)

Leena Areso, who worked as a commissioned sales consultant for CarMax, filed this class action lawsuit, asserting that she and the members of the putative class were owed unpaid overtime. Areso argued that CarMax's uniform payment of approximately $150 per vehicle is piece-rate compensation rather than a commission because it is not based on a percentage of the sale amount. The Court of Appeal affirmed summary judgment in favor of CarMax, concluding that the payment system was a commission within the meaning of Labor Code § 204.1 because "[p]aying salespeople a uniform fee for each vehicle is proportionate – a one to one proportion. The compensation will rise and fall in direct proportion to the number of vehicles sold." See also Flores v. Lamps Plus, Inc., 195 Cal. App. 4th 389 (2011) (yet another opinion concluding that the "provide" rather than "ensure" standard governs an employer's obligation with respect to meal and rest breaks); United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Superior Court, 196 Cal. App. 4th 57 (2011) (employees who miss both meal and rest breaks in a single workday may be entitled to up to two premium payments under Labor Code § 226.7).

California Overtime Rules Apply To Out-of-State Residents Who Work In The State

Sullivan v. Oracle Corp., 2011 WL 2569530 (Cal. S. Ct. 2011)

In this case, the California Supreme Court answered three questions certified to it by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit as follows: (1) California's overtime law applies to work performed in California for a California employer by nonresident workers; (2) the Unfair Competition Law ("UCL") applies to violations of the overtime law; and (3) the UCL does not apply to claims brought under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA") for overtime work performed in other states by nonresidents. See also Probert v. Family Centered Servs. of Alaska, 2011 WL 2473954 (9th Cir. 2011) (FLSA does not cover homes where "severely emotionally disturbed" children reside).

Unlicensed Junior Accountants May Be Exempt From Overtime

Campbell v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2011 WL 2342740 (9th Cir. 2011)

Two thousand unlicensed junior accountants brought this wage-and-hour class action against PwC, alleging they were improperly classified as exempt from overtime. The parties filed cross-motions for partial summary judgment, and the district court granted the employees' motion, holding as a matter of law that they were not exempt under the professional or administrative exemptions. The Ninth Circuit reversed on the ground that a material question of fact existed as to whether the employees' duties met the requirement of a "learned" or "artistic" profession (and are therefore exempt) even though they are not licensed. The Court also held there were "numerous factual disputes in the record" that precluded summary judgment with respect to the administrative exemption.

Attorney Who "Excessively Reviewed" Privileged Documents Misappropriated By His Client Was Properly Disqualified

Clark v. Superior Court, 196 Cal. App. 4th 37 (2011)

While he worked as VeriSign's chief administrative officer, Grant Clark signed VeriSign's nondisclosure agreement, which included a provision that he would not remove VeriSign's confidential or privileged information and that he would return any such documents in his possession upon termination of his employment. Clark was terminated effective December 31, 2008, and in January 2009 he filed a lawsuit against VeriSign through his attorneys, Higgs, Fletcher & Mack LLP. The trial court disqualified the Higgs firm from continuing to represent Clark after Clark conceded in his deposition that he used privileged VeriSign documents as the basis for his securities fraud and breach of contract claims. The Court of Appeal denied Clark's petition for a writ of mandate after determining that Higgs received and "excessively reviewed" privileged documents from Clark. See also Moody v. Staar Surgical Co., 195 Cal. App. 4th 1043 (2011) (employer's attorney was properly sanctioned $1,500 for asking a question of a witness at trial after being instructed by the judge not to inquire into a particular area).

$22.5 Million Verdict Reversed Where Employer Admitted Its Vicarious Liability For Employee's Negligence

Diaz v. Carcamo, 2011 WL 2473597 (Cal. S. Ct. 2011)

Jose Carcamo, a truck driver for defendant Sugar Transport, caused Dawn Renae Diaz to suffer severe permanent injuries as a result of a traffic accident on Highway 101. Diaz sued Carcamo and Sugar Transport, alleging that Sugar Transport was both vicariously liable for Carcamo's negligent driving and directly liable for its own negligence in hiring and retaining Carcamo. At trial, Sugar Transport offered to admit vicarious liability if Carcamo were found negligent. Sugar Transport contended that such an admission should bar Diaz from further pursuing her claims for negligent entrustment, hiring and retention of Carcamo. Over Sugar Transport's objection, the trial court admitted evidence of Carcamo's two prior accidents; that he was in the U.S. illegally; that he had used a phony Social Security number to obtain employment; that he had been fired from or quit without good reason three of his last four driving jobs; that he had lied on his application; and that the only reference from his prior employers consisted of a "very negative evaluation." The California Supreme Court reversed the judgment (over $22.5 million in damages) after concluding Sugar Transport was prejudiced by admission of evidence concerning Carcamo after it admitted to vicarious liability for his actions.

Manager's Defamation Action Against Striking Union Could Proceed

Price v. Operating Eng'rs Local Union No. 3, 195 Cal. App. 4th 962 (2011)

During the course of a strike, members of the union placed copies of a flyer on the doors and cars of the neighbors of the employer's vice president and general manager Jim Price that said: "Neighbors, beware of this man: Jim Price"; "protect your family, safeguard your property"; and "complain to [his apartment complex] about the sort of person they've let in your community." The flyer listed Price's business cell phone number and his apartment number and encouraged Price's neighbors to complain to him directly. Another flyer stated: "Resident Jim Price tried to take away workers' pension benefits"; "threatened workers with arrest for publicizing their fight for workplace justice"; and "threatened to use armed guards against the workers to shut down their strike." In response to Price's lawsuit against the union for defamation and violation of Civil Code §§ 51.7 and 52.1, the union moved to strike the complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16). The trial court denied the motion on the ground that the union's disparaging statements about Price involved an issue of private as opposed to public interest. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment. See also Fox v. Vice, 563 U.S. ___, 131 S. Ct. 2205 (2011) (when a lawsuit involves both frivolous and non-frivolous claims, a court may grant reasonable fees to the defendant, but only for fees the defendant incurred as a result of the frivolous claims).

Termination Of Employee On FMLA Leave Who Submitted Inadequate Medical Information Did Not Violate Federal Law

Lewis v. United States, 641 F.3d 1174 (9th Cir. 2011)

Janet Lewis worked for the United States Air Force as the director of a child development center on the Elmendorf Air Force Base. In 2006, Lewis requested 120 days of leave without pay pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA"). The employer requested a medical certification to support Lewis's request for FMLA leave. In response, Lewis submitted three documents: (1) a prescription from her psychiatrist; (2) a letter from her psychiatrist; and (3) a WH-380 (medical leave form). Although Lewis's supervisor told her the documents she had submitted were insufficient to support her request for FMLA leave, Lewis refused to submit more information. The employer converted Lewis's status to absent without leave ("AWOL") and subsequently terminated her employment. Lewis sued for unlawful removal from employment pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 7702. The district court granted summary judgment to the employer, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that because Lewis's WH-380 form stated only that she was diagnosed with "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and needed therapy, medical treatment, bed rest, two prescription medications, and 120 days off work," she had failed to provide a "summary of the medical facts that support the diagnosis."  The Court noted that "the form contains no explanation as to why Lewis was unable to perform her work duties and no discussion about whether additional treatments would be required for her condition. When Lewis refused to submit any further documentation, her medical certification remained deficient." See also Davis v. Superior Court, 196 Cal. App. 4th 669 (2011) (granting petition for writ of mandate directing trial court to enter its final judgment so that employee could file a notice of appeal).

False Claims Act Lawsuit Was Barred By Public Disclosure Of Records

Schindler Elevator Corp. v. United States ex rel. Kirk, 563 U.S. ___, 131 S. Ct. 1885 (2011)

Daniel Kirk, a former employee of Schindler Elevator Corporation, filed this lawsuit under the False Claims Act ("FCA"), alleging Schindler had submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the United States. Kirk alleged the company had falsely certified its compliance with the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1972. To support his allegations, Kirk relied upon information that his wife had received from the Department of Labor ("DOL") in response to three Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") requests she had made. Schindler moved to dismiss Kirk's lawsuit on a number of grounds, including that the FCA's public disclosure bar deprived the district court of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court resolved a conflict among the circuit courts of appeals and held that a "report" as used in the FCA's public disclosure bar carries its ordinary meaning and that the DOL's written responses to Mrs. Kirk's FOIA requests were therefore "reports." See also County of Kern v. Jadwin, 2011 WL 2611819 (Cal. Ct. App. 2011) (employer's state law FCA claim that was filed against former employee who had successfully sued for violation of his employment rights was frivolous and brought to harass employee).
