Asda may not make use of a controversial new contract clause allowing it to change staff hours at four weeks's notice, the retailer has claimed.

The clause is at the heart of the row over the contract, in which up to 300 workers face the sack if they do not sign by the new deadline of 10 November.

A GMB Union spokesman claimed Asda could face a "flood" of unfair or constructive dismissal claims. "Some of our members have husbands with cancer or their kids are severely disabled," he said. "They have six hours' care a week and that's when they do their Asda shift. Saying they need to be available any time is in effect dismissing them and those people would have a constructive dismissal case."

GMB lawyers also believed such workers who had signed the contract could argue they were a victim of indirect discrimination if a shift change had a disproportionate effect on them, the spokesman added.

Asda claimed GMB's argument was hypothetical since there was nothing to suggest staff in such circumstances would be asked to work hours they were unable to. It said it remained aware of its legal obligations and would not ask staff to work shifts it was clear they could not, despite the new clause.

The company claims to have been clear it understands people have responsibilities outside work and will always help them to balance those with work. "We will not be asking them to constantly move the time they work, their days or departments," a spokesman added.

The new contract raises the lowest store wage rate from £8.21 to £9, with a further rise to £9.18 from April next year. It also scraps paid breaks, leading GMB to claim that many staff will be worse off over a shift.

Asda can also change a worker's department at four weeks' notice under the new terms.

Rakel Bryan has spoken of her treatment by staff at an Asda in Hull after she was banned last month

A women who jokingly called a shop assistant a dkhead feels like staff are staring at her following her ban from the shop.

Rakel Bryan was barred from the Hull store after having an argument with a member of staff over cigarette papers.

The 29-year-old was challenged by the vendor about her age when she tried to buy the smoking paraphernalia, prompting her to blurt out the slur.

“I said 'aw shut up dkhead', as a joke. I thought he was laughing with me and then he said, ‘no I’m being serious’," Rakel said.

“I said ‘how dare you ID me’.

“I had a panic attack, I felt like everyone was staring at me.”

The day after the October 16 confrontation Rakel was "frog marched" from the shop and handed a three year ban, Hull Daily Mail reported .

But the spurned shopper has to accompany her mum -who has mobility issues -to the Asda shop, leading to awkward encounters.

"I feel like I'm being treated like a criminal and feel really intimidated when I go near the store," she said.

"I have to hang about where my mum goes to do her shopping in 15 to 20 minutes.

"It's like I'm a naughty child and I have to stand outside on the naughty step or something.

"It's been four or five times where I have been to Asda, and because my mum is unsteady on her feet we wouldn't go into town [city centre].

"We eat fresh and visit [Asda] most days to get ingredients for our tea."

In a further meeting with the store manager Rakel was told she had been banned because she 'had been racist", she claimed.

She refuted the suggestion and spoke about how the ban had impacted her life.

"Staff members are eyeballing while I'm stood outside -it's a little bit embarrassing more than anything," Rakel added.

"It has just been blown out of proportion and now I have to stand outside like a naughty child."

An Asda spokesperson confirmed the ban and said: "While we would never discuss individual circumstances, we take any concerns of this nature seriously and will not tolerate any form of abuse or discrimination towards our customers or colleagues."

Justice Department Files Suit Against Walmart Inc. to Enforce Employment Rights of Naval Reservist

The Department of Justice filed a complaint today in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado on behalf of Naval Petty Officer Third Class Lindsey Hunger against Walmart Inc. The complaint alleges that Walmart violated the law when it declined to hire Hunger due to her upcoming naval reserve duties.

Servicemembers risk their lives to protect all of us. They deserve our full support, and the law does not permit employers to use military service as a reason to deny servicemembers jobs and other employment opportunities, said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division. Defending servicemembers is very important, and the U.S. Department of Justice will continue aggressively to enforce the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act and other federal laws that protect servicemembers.

The members of our Armed Forces routinely make personal sacrifices to protect our nation. The least we can do as a nation is ensure they arent discriminated against for making these sacrifices, said U.S. Attorney Jason R. Dunn of the District of Colorado. When such discrimination does occur, this office and the Department of Justice will step in to right that wrong.

Hunger alleges that in May 2016 she applied for a summer job at Walmart while she was a member of the United States Naval Reserve. After applying online, she received a call from Walmarts personnel coordinator for the Walmart located at 2545 Rimrock Avenue in Grand Junction, Colorado. At the end of the call, Hunger mentioned that she was required to complete a mandatory two-week annual training for her Navy Reserve duty during the summer. The Personnel Coordinator responded by telling Hunger that Walmart could not support that time off, and ended the call. Walmart never called Hunger again about her application for employment. Hunger, who was supporting two young children at the time, could not find other employment in Grand Junction during the summer and fall of 2016.

The lawsuit alleges that Walmarts conduct violated the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, which was passed 25 years ago to protect the rights of servicemembers. The law, known as USERRA, protects servicemembers from discrimination in employment because of their service to their country in any branch of the military. This lawsuit stems from a referral to the United States Department of Justice from the United States Department of Labor, after an investigation by the Department of Labors Veterans Employment and Training Service.

The Justice Department gives high priority to the enforcement of servicemembers rights under USERRA. Additional information about USERRA can be found on the Justice Departments websites at www.justice.gov/crt-military/employment-rights-userra and www.justice.gov/servicemembers as well as on the Department of Labors (DOL) website at www.dol.gov/vets/programs/userra.

This case is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney Zeyen Wu in the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Colorado.

Flipkart India received three sexual harassment complaints this financial year and all of them were investigated out of which one of the complaint was disposed off, according to the documents. In May last year, Walmart said it had agreed to pay $16 billion for about 77 per cent stake in Flipkart, a transaction that valued Flipkart for over $20 billion. Experts tracking both the firms say that while the Bentonville-headquartered company has brought in greater synergies leveraging the expertise of Flipkart group companies, the company may not have been able to fully exploit the India potential owing to regulatory hurdles and fierce competition from global rival Amazon.

Traders’ body writes to PM cautioning against ceding ground to global players The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi accusing Walmart CEO of trying to put pressure on the government to open up the country’s retail market by making a plea for stability in business environment.

“We firmly believe there is no instability in the economic foundations or policy structure of the government. These kind of rhetoric by global players is a pressure tactic to find a headway into the large existing business potential of India’s large retail market and directly control our economy by indulging in unfair and monopolistic business practices,” the letter written by CAIT National Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said.

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon had written to Modi stating that a stable, welcoming regulatory environment would allow the company to continue to invest in creating more jobs and building infrastructure that benefited Indian suppliers and customers.

Khandelwal said the Walmart chief had made his observations at a time when Commerce & Minister Piyush Goyal had made a public statement reiterating that e-commerce entities have no right to offer any discount or indulge in predatory pricing.

Khandelwal added that over the last few weeks, he had pointed out the various “unfair and unethical’’ business practices of large foreign retail companies operating in India, to the Commerce Minister. “They have blatantly and openly violated the FDI policy by indulging in malpractices such as deep discounting, predatory pricing, exclusivity & discriminatory seller treatment and control over inventory,” he said, adding that the government should not cede any ground to these global players.

New Delhi: Walmart CEO Doug McMillon has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on issues related to data privacy and regulatory stability for the e-commerce sector and has urged him to reduce the number of licences and permits for the opening of new stores.

McMillon in a letter has assured the Prime Minister of Walmart's commitment to increasing global sourcing from India, empower small and medium enterprises and more job creation.

McMillon had met Modi during the prime minister's recent US visit. Global retail giant Walmart, which has invested $16 billion in Flipkart, is facing challenges after the foreign direct investment rules for e-commerce marketplaces were changed by the government through a revised policy on FDI in online retail.

"A stable, welcoming regulatory environment will allow us to continue to invest in creating more jobs and building infrastructure that benefits the Indian suppliers and customers," McMillon said in the letter.

He also appreciated the prime minister for listening to the retailer's concerns on regulatory stability and uniform implementation of regulations in the e-commerce and retail sectors.

"We have been encouraged by the recent consultations with your government and we remain ready to collaborate to ensure proper protection while creating a pro-growth agenda," it said.

The new FDI policy, which has come into effect from February this year has barred online marketplaces like Flipkart and Amazon from selling products of companies where they hold stakes and banned exclusive marketing arrangements that could influence product price.

It also mandates them to offer equal services or facilities to all its vendors without discrimination. Moreover, both leading online sellers are also facing regulatory investigations here for alleged violation of the guidelines by predatory pricing and deep discounting.

Doug McMillon has also raised the issues related to data privacy saying regulating new technologies are issues which are faced by the governments around the world.

"High number of overlapping permits are challenge in the retail sector as well. On average, we currently need more than 45 permits and three years to open a new best price store.

This is significantly longer than it takes in the US and many markets in which we operate," it said.

Rakel Bryan says she is 'fuming'

A woman has been handed a ban form Asda for three years.

Rakel Bryan, 29, from Hull, said she has been barred from the supermarket following an argument with a shop assistant at the Beverley Road store after she was asked for ID for cigarette papers.

She told Hull Live she is a regular shopper there and "fuming" with the decision.

She said: “I thought it was a joke, I’m absolutely fuming. I go in there every day to do shopping for my mum because she can’t get about very well.

“I don’t like the way I’ve been treated - I feel like I am being bullied."

“I said ‘how dare you ID me?’.

“I had a panic attack, I felt like everyone was staring at me.”

Ms Bryan said a confrontation followed a security guard took her out of the shop and calmed her down.

The next day, when she went in to the shop again, she was informed by staff she had been banned from the store for three years.

She arranged to meet the manager at 5pm the following Friday.

She said: “He was rude and didn’t listen to what I had to say and said the reason I was banned was because I had been racist."

Ms Bryan denies the accusation.

Ms Bryan said she went into the shop with her friend Roxanne Marshall on Thursday after being told she was allowed to by the employee on the door.

But she claims she was confronted again by other members of staff.

Ms Marshall said: “She was told she could come in. She only had a stew pack and some sausages.

“As I was walking up I could see two staff verbally abusing her. They were right in her face. I said there is no need for that it’s bullying. They told her you’re never coming in here again.”

An Asda spokesman said: “While we would never discuss individual circumstances, we take any concerns of this nature seriously and will not tolerate any form of abuse or discrimination towards our customers or colleagues.”

Rakel Bryan thought the shop assistant was joking when she heard of the ban the next day

A shopper has been banned from Asda for three years after a row over cigarette papers.

Rakel Bryan, 29, from Hull, visited her local Beverley Road store on Wednesday and was ID'd over a pack of Zig-Zags.

She then lashed out at the worker and suffered a panic attack.

Rakel told Hull Live: “I thought it was a joke, I’m absolutely fuming. I go in there every day to do shopping for my mum because she can’t get about very well."

"I don’t like the way I’ve been treated – I feel like I am being bullied."

“I said ‘how dare you ID me’.

"I had a panic attack, I felt like everyone was staring at me.”

An argument followed until a security guard escorted her outside and helped calm her down.

When Rakel entered the store the following day, she was shocked to discover that she has been barred from entering the supermarket for the next three years.

Rakel requested a meeting with the manager at 5pm.

She said: “He was rude and didn’t listen to what I had to say and said the reason I was banned was because I had been racist."

Rakel fumed: “I’m not a racist, I had an ex-boyfriend who was black.”

She returned again the the store on Thursday with her friend Roxanne Marshall and was told she could enter the supermarket by a colleague on the door.

She was quickly confronted by other staff members once inside.

Roxanne said: “She was told she could come in. She only had a stew pack and some sausages.

“As I was walking up I could see two staff verbally abusing her. They were right in her face. I said there is no need for that it’s bullying. They told her you’re never coming in here again.”

A WOMAN said she was left ‘fuming’ after being hit with a three-year ban from Asda following a row over being ID’d.

Rakel Bryan, 29, claims she thought it was “a joke” when she was barred from the family supermarket following an argument with a shop assistant.

She said she had called the worker “a d***head as a joke” when he asked to see her ID for a packet of cigarette papers in Hull – and then a row broke out.

Rakel was later led out of the shop by a security guard and told she had been banned for three years after the outburst.

‘HOW DARE YOU’

Speaking to Hull Live , Rakel said: “I said ‘aw shut up d**khead’, as a joke. I thought he was laughing with me and then he said, ‘no I’m being serious’. I said ‘how dare you ID me?’.

“I thought it was a joke, I’m absolutely fuming. I go in there every day to do shopping for my mum because she can’t get about very well. I don’t like the way I’ve been treated – I feel like I am being bullied.”

Rakel agreed to meet with the store’s manager the following week, but claims he was rude and accused her of being a racist.

She added: “He was rude and didn’t listen to what I had to say and said the reason I was banned was because I had been racist. I’m not a racist, I had an ex-boyfriend who was black.”

Rakel later tried to enter the shop again with friend Roxanne Marshall after reportedly being told she could by an employee on the door – however claims she was later confronted and told to leave by other staff.

An Asda spokesman said: “While we would never discuss individual circumstances, we take any concerns of this nature seriously and will not tolerate any form of abuse or discrimination towards our customers or colleagues.”

Ms Marshall said: “She was told she could come in. She only had a stew pack and some sausages.

“As I was walking up I could see two staff verbally abusing her. They were right in her face. I said there is no need for that it’s bullying. They told her you’re never coming in here again.”

An Asda spokesman said: “While we would never discuss individual circumstances, we take any concerns of this nature seriously and will not tolerate any form of abuse or discrimination towards our customers or colleagues.”

A WOMAN said she was left ‘fuming’ after being hit with a three-year ban from Asda following a row over being ID’d.

Rakel Bryan, 29, claims she thought it was “a joke” when she was barred from the family supermarket following an argument with a shop assistant.

She said she had called the worker “a d***head as a joke” when he asked to see her ID for a packet of cigarette papers in Hull – and then a row broke out.

Rakel was later led out of the shop by a security guard and told she had been banned for three years after the outburst.

‘HOW DARE YOU’

Speaking to Hull Live, Rakel said: “I said ‘aw shut up d**khead’, as a joke. I thought he was laughing with me and then he said, ‘no I’m being serious’. I said ‘how dare you ID me?’.

“I thought it was a joke, I’m absolutely fuming. I go in there every day to do shopping for my mum because she can’t get about very well. I don’t like the way I’ve been treated – I feel like I am being bullied.”

Rakel agreed to meet with the store’s manager the following week, but claims he was rude and accused her of being a racist.

She added: “He was rude and didn’t listen to what I had to say and said the reason I was banned was because I had been racist. I’m not a racist, I had an ex-boyfriend who was black.”

Rakel later tried to enter the shop again with friend Roxanne Marshall after reportedly being told she could by an employee on the door – however claims she was later confronted and told to leave by other staff.

An Asda spokesman said: “While we would never discuss individual circumstances, we take any concerns of this nature seriously and will not tolerate any form of abuse or discrimination towards our customers or colleagues.”

Elizabeth Warren says she was fired for being pregnant, but such    discrimination  remains a widespread problem; Walmart, UPS and other major employers have faced charges of mistreating pregnant workers

Walmart, UPS and other major employers have faced charges of mistreating pregnant workers

Walmart, UPS and other major employers have faced charges of mistreating pregnant workers

Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s story about being fired early in her career because she was pregnant may sound like an artifact from a less enlightened era, but pregnancy-discrimination cases are not uncommon in Corporate America today.

Warren — a Democrat from Massachusetts who’s vying for the Democratic nomination — told CBS News that she was fired for being pregnant in 1971. She then urged other women to share their stories of pregnancy discrimination on Twitter (TWTR, US).

“This was 1971, years before Congress outlawed pregnancy discrimination — but we know it still happens in subtle and not-so-subtle ways,” she wrote.

The Pregnancy Discrimination Act passed in 1978, but more than 40 years later discrimination against pregnant workers is still “incredibly common,” said Alex Baptiste, policy counsel at the National Partnership for Women & Families, an organization that advocates for adequate health care, reproductive rights, equal pay and family-friendly policies. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission fielded more than 2,000 complaints of pregnancy discrimination in 2018.

“It impacts people across industry, pay scale, race, ethnicity, background — it can happen in any work environment and in any state,” Baptiste said.

Some of the country’s biggest employers, including Walmart (WMT, US) and UPS (UPS, US), have been the focus of pregnancy-discrimination complaints, and a 2018 New York Times investigation explored its presence across sectors, from financial firms to factory floors.

A report in the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication, questioned Warren’s account, citing the minutes of a Riverdale Board of Education meeting on April 21, 1971. Hundreds of women on social media subsequently shared their own stories of more subtle forms of discrimination, and being forced out and also frozen out by an organization when managers discovered they were pregnant.

Warren, meanwhile, said she didn’t previously share the details of her exit from that teaching post, telling CBS News: “After becoming a public figure I opened up more about different pieces in my life, and this was one of them. I wrote about it in my book when I became a U.S. senator.”

Pregnancy discrimination can be as overt as an employer firing a worker when they find out she’s pregnant, but it also includes less explicit forms of unfair treatment, like not letting a pregnant worker have a water bottle near her work area, Baptiste said. “All of these things have real consequences and affect a pregnant worker’s employment, earnings and opportunity,” she added.

https://twitter.com/saints618/status/1181645489516814337The changing demographics of the American workforce are one factor in the persistence of this type of discrimination.

“Over the last several years, as more women entered the workforce, and have moved into more occupations or industries that were previously male dominated, there’s been an increase in denial of requests for accommodations for pregnant workers, and firing them for doing so,” said Maya Raghu, director of workplace equality and senior counsel at the National Women’s Law Center, an organization that supports advocates, experts, and lawyers who work for gender equality in the workplace.

What’s more, women are far more likely to work while they’re pregnant than in decades past, and they tend to work until they are further along in their pregnancies, a 2015 Pew Research Center analysis found.

The NWLC filed a class-action lawsuit in 2017 against Walmart on behalf of pregnant workers, one of whom said the company denied her request to not lift heavy objects or climb ladders while pregnant. The EEOC filed a similar suit against the mega-retailer in 2018. Both suits are ongoing. Walmart did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

https://twitter.com/summerbrennan/status/1181385219489898496The EEOC has brought several pregnancy-discrimination cases recently against employers:

• UPS, which lost a pregnancy- discrimination case before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015, paid a $2.25 million settlement in September to settle charges that it did not provide light duty accommodations to pregnant workers. A UPS spokesman told MarketWatch, “UPS works closely with our female employees to make their work experience a positive one throughout their pregnancies, the births of their children, and caring for related medical conditions. Our maternity leave benefits have included paid time off and opportunities for light duty work assignments for several years.”

• EEOC sued Tacoma, Washington’s Oatridge Security in September after a supervisor allegedly told a pregnant worker that working security “wasn’t proper” for a pregnant woman. The company did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

• Chain retailer Party City (PRTY, US)  paid a $39,000 settlement in July after the company allegedly fired a Texas worker because she was pregnant. The company did not respond to a request for comment.

Advocates are now pushing for stronger protections for pregnant workers and want Congress to pass a new law called the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.

The 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act went a long way in providing protections for pregnant workers, but there are still “major holes” in protections for millions of employees, Baptiste said. “The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would close that protection gap, make reasonable accommodations available to pregnant workers when requested, and allow more pregnant workers to remain in the workforce at a time when the income and benefits are most needed.”

Walmart Balks at $5.2 Million Damages Claim for Disability Bias Against Employee

Andrew G. Simpson

Insurance Journal

A jury last week found that Walmart violated federal law for failing to accommodate the disabilities of a longtime employee and awarded $5.2 million in damages.

After a 3½-day trial, the jury sided with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and awarded the employee $200,000 in compensatory damages and an additional $5 million in punitive damages.

However, Walmart maintains that it attempted to accommodate the employee. The giant retailer also contends that the penalty exceeds a federal cap on such damages, and it will seek to have it reduced.

"We believe the compensatory damages were excessive and the court erred in allowing the jury to assess punitive damages at all. Under federal law the combined amount of damages is capped at $300,000," Randy Hargrove, Walmart's national media relations director, told Insurance Journal.

The EEOC told Insurance Journal that Walmart is right that the law caps damages at $300,000.

The lawsuit brought by the EEOC claimed that an employee, who has a developmental disability and is deaf and visually impaired, worked as a cart pusher in the Beloit, Wis., Walmart for 16 years before a new manager started at the store. "In his first month, the new store manager suspended the employee and forced him to resubmit medical paperwork in order to keep his reasonable accommodations," the EEOC said in its statement. "Prior to the suspension, the employee performed his job with the accommodation of assistance from a job coach provided by public funding. The employee's conditions had not changed."

The EEOC charged that when the employee and his legal guardian submitted new medical paperwork requesting the continued accommodation of assistance from a job coach, the store "cut off communication and effectively terminated him."

"Employers have a legal obligation under federal law to work with employees who need accom­modations for disabilities," said Gregory Gochanour, regional attorney for the EEOC's Chicago District. "When companies shirk that obligation, the EEOC will fight to uphold the rights of disability discrimin­ation victims. In this case the jury sent a strong message to Walmart and to other employers that if they fail to live up to their obligations under the law, they will be penalized."

Walmart has a different view of what happened.

"When a new manager started at our store, safety concerns for Mr. Reina led our store manager to ask for an official accommodations review process. After we applied the official accommodations review process, it was determined Mr. Reina could not perform the essential parts of his job with or without reasonable accommodations. As a result, he is no longer working at the store," the company said in a statement to Insurance Journal.

Hargrove said Walmart is "deeply sorry this matter reached this point" and is considering its options.

"We don't tolerate discrimination of any kind, and we routinely accommodate thousands of associates every year. We attempted to accommodate Mr. Reina's severe limitations for several years but ultimately that was no longer feasible. We believe we could have resolved this issue with Mr. Reina, however the EEOC's demands were unreasonable. We are disappointed in the outcome, do not believe the verdict is supported by the evidence and are weighing our post-trial options," the company said.

In Furtherance of the meeting held between Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) and Amazon and Flipkart on October 11 at Udyog Bhawan, New Delhi.

CAIT on Sunday sent communications to all premier brands whose products are being sold on e-commerce portals of both Amazon and Flipkart asking them to clarify whether deep discounts on various products on Amazon and Flipkart are being offered by them as claimed by both Amazon and Flipkart in the said meeting which was convened by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Ministry of Commerce under the directions of Piyush Goyal, Minister of Commerce and Industry.

CAIT National President BC Bhartia in communication to brands said that on question of offering deep discounts on various products on their respective portals, both Amazon and Flipkart categorically said that the portals are not offering any discounts and it is various brands which are offering such deep discounts and Amazon and Flipkart have no role in discounts on their portals.

In another question, both Amazon and Flipkart said that it is the brands that give their exclusive products to sellers and they have no role in it.

"This is their official statement given in an official meeting convened by the Ministry of Commerce-add both leaders," he further said.

Bhartia said, "Such a statement by Amazon and Flipkart reflects the dual policy of the brands by having different sets of price and discount structure both for off-line and on-line trade which amounts to discrimination and leads to unfair business practices not allowed under business norms."

Elaborating on the crucial role of traders, he said, "Traders across the country are working with brands since decades have every faith and trust on brands as far as their price policy is concerned." However, since the responsibility of discounts has been shifted on brands in a most authorized manner and in a meeting convened by the Government, the Confederation of All India Traders takes a serious note of it.

Asking a clarification from brands, Secretary-General of CAIT Praveen Khandelwal said to each brand that "since your brand is also being sold on Amazon/Flipkart e-commerce portals, we shall be grateful to you to clarify whether discounts offered on these portals are offered by you? This is necessary as we will take up this matter further with the top leadership of the Government."

Confederation of All India Traders also expressed its intention to convene a conference of brands in New Delhi and have requested them to confirm the participation of your esteemed organization. Khandelwal said that crores of traders across country have a major contribution in present valuation of the brands by rendering yeomen services and putting huge investments by delivering good sine very nook and corner of the country since decades incapacity of distributors, wholesalers, semi- wholesalers, retailers and in various capacities and have built a strong supply chain in the country which is world's largest supply.

Khandelwal said, "Being apex body of traders of the country representing about 7 crore traders through more than 40,000 trade associations across country, we are deeply concerned on this very important and critical issue which has created an adverse impact on off-line business throughout the country and we are determined to take this issue to its logical conclusion through whatever lawful course available with us. Therefore, your clarification on deep discounting and exclusivity assumes much significance to air out the confusion being raised by the official statement of both Amazon and Flipkart."

MADISON, Wis., Oct. 11 -- The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued the following press release:

Late yesterday, a jury determined that Walmart violated federal law when it refused to accommodate the disabilities of a longtime employee, and awarded $5.2 million in damages, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) announced today.

According to the EEOC's lawsuit, an employee, who has a developmental disability and is deaf and visually impaired, worked as a cart pusher in the Beloit, Wis., Walmart for 16 years before a new manager started at the store. In his first month, the new store manager suspended the employee and forced him to resubmit medical paperwork in order to keep his reasonable accommodations. Prior to the suspension, the employee performed his job with the accommodation of assistance from a job coach provided by public funding. The employee's conditions had not changed, the EEOC said.

When the employee and his legal guardian submitted new medical paperwork, requesting the continued accommodation of assistance from a job coach, the store cut off communication and effectively terminated him, the EEOC charged.

After a 3.5 day trial, the jury found in favor of the EEOC and awarded the employee $200,000 in compensatory damages and an additional $5 million in punitive damages.

"Employers have a legal obligation under federal law to work with employees who need accommodations for disabilities," said Gregory Gochanour, regional attorney for the EEOC's Chicago District. "When companies shirk that obligation, the EEOC will fight to uphold the rights of disability discrimination victims. In this case the jury sent a strong message to Walmart and to other employers that if they fail to live up to their obligations under the law, they will be penalized."

The case was tried for the EEOC by Laurie Vasichek, Carrie Vance and Jean Kamp.

The EEOC's Chicago District is responsible for investigating charges of employment discrimination, administrative enforcement, and the conduct of agency litigation in Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota, with Area Offices in Milwaukee and Minneapolis.

The EEOC advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says the jury determined that Walmart violated federal law when it refused to accommodate the man's disabilities.

The man has a developmental disability and is deaf and visually impaired. He worked as a cart pusher at a Walmart in Beloit for 16 years before a new manager started at the store in 2015.

The EEOC says the new manager made the employee resubmit medical paperwork to keep his accommodations. When the employee requested continued assistance from a job coach, the EEOC alleges he was effectively terminated.

CAIT considering to take on other brands over discounts

Copyright 2019. KNN India. 

New Delhi, Oct 4 (KNN) After dragging e-tailers like Amazon and Flipkart to the court, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) is all considering to take on those retail brands which offer huge discounts in the online segment, unlike in offline stores.

''How can brands have discriminatory price policy between offline and online retailers. If its so its against the completion law and the CAIT will be forced to file complaint against such brands in Competition Commission of India and will also make them party in ongoing case at Rajasthan High Court for using non-ethical practices helping e commerce players,'' CAIT said in a press release.

CAIT National President B C Bhartia and Praveen Khandelwal said that even if its found true but contribution of these brands in sales of both e com players is very negligible. There are hundreds of other items including electronics, mobile phones, FMCG products, kitchen accessories, home furnishing, gift articles, watches, footwear, readade garments and others where deep discounts are offered by these players which is more significant. Therefore they cannot absolve from their responsibility of offering high value discounts , directly or indirectly controlling inventory, influencing prices and creating an uneven level playing field and all these conditions are clear violation of FDI policy of the Government.

CAIT on Tuesday had moved to Rajasthan High Court seeking a stay on festive sales by e-tailers Amazon and Flipkart for alleged violation of foreign direct investment (FDI) norms following which the court has issued notices to Flipkart India and its marketplace entity Flipkart Internet, and Amazon Seller Services.

''In response to court case filed by Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) in Rajasthan High Court against unethical practices of Amazon and Flipkart, we have seen media reports where they have claimed that they are not offering discounts rather they passed the buck on few brands that they are giving discounts. The CAIT said that its a blatant lie to cover up their unethical trade practices,'' the release further read.

Walmart sued by EEOC over treatment of job applicant at Ochelata distribution facility

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claims Walmart Stores East LP violated federal law when it declined a job applicant at its Ochelata distribution center a chance to take a prehiring physical assessment test and did not hire her.

According to a lawsuit filed this week in U.S. District Court in Tulsa, Emily Hayman, born with her right arm ending at the elbow, applied for a freight handler position in March 2018.

She had warehouse experience such as lifting and moving ceramic toilets weighing up to 200 pounds without the use of a prosthetic, documents claim. Hayman interviewed for the position and watched a video demonstrating the physical assessment test. When asked whether she needed an accommodation to take the assessment, Hayman declined, but Walmart did not allow her to take the assessment without a prosthetic, records show.

Hayman doesn’t use or own a prosthetic, according to the lawsuit.

The EEOC claims that Walmart violated the Americans with Disabilities Act. The agency seeks monetary damages, training on anti-discrimination laws, posting of anti-discrimination notices at the worksite and other injunctive relief.

“This case is a clear example of an employer jumping to conclusions based on an applicant’s obvious disability,” Andrea G. Baran, the EEOC’s regional attorney in St. Louis, said in a statement. “This type of bias against workers with disabilities is exactly what the ADA was enacted to prevent.”

The EEOC’s St. Louis District Office oversees Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma and southern Illinois. It advances opportunity in the workplace by enforcing federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claims Walmart Stores East LP violated federal law when it declined a job applicant at its Ochelata distribution center a chance to take a prehiring physical assessment test and did not hire her.

According to a lawsuit filed this week in U.S. District Court in Tulsa, Emily Hayman, born with her right arm ending at the elbow, applied for a freight handler position in March 2018.

She had warehouse experience such as lifting and moving ceramic toilets weighing up to 200 pounds without the use of a prosthetic, documents claim. Hayman interviewed for the position and watched a video demonstrating the physical assessment test. When asked whether she needed an accommodation to take the assessment, Hayman declined, but Walmart did not allow her to take the assessment without a prosthetic, records show.

Hayman doesn’t use or own a prosthetic, according to the lawsuit.

The EEOC claims that Walmart violated the Americans with Disabilities Act. The agency seeks monetary damages, training on anti-discrimination laws, posting of anti-discrimination notices at the worksite and other injunctive relief.

“This case is a clear example of an employer jumping to conclusions based on an applicant’s obvious disability,” Andrea G. Baran, the EEOC’s regional attorney in St. Louis, said in a statement. “This type of bias against workers with disabilities is exactly what the ADA was enacted to prevent.”

OCHELATA Wal-Mart Stores East LP violated federal law when it declined a job applicant the opportunity to take a pre-hiring physical assessment test and did not hire the applicant, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charged in a lawsuit filed Wednesday.

According to the lawsuit, the applicant, who was born with her right arm ending at the elbow, sought a freight handler position at Walmart’s Distribution Center in Ochelata. She had warehouse experience lifting items up to 200 pounds without the use of a prosthetic. The applicant successfully interviewed for the position and watched a video demonstrating the physical assessment test. When asked whether she needed an accommodation to take the assessment, the applicant declined. Walmart nonetheless did not allow her to take the assessment without a prosthetic.

The conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act, according to the EEOC lawsuit.

The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma. The agency seeks monetary damages, training on anti-discrimination laws, posting of anti-discrimination notices at the worksite, and other injunctive relief.

“This case is a clear example of an employer jumping to conclusions based on an applicant’s obvious disability,” said Andrea G. Baran, the EEOC’s regional attorney in St. Louis.

Not Yet Down for the Count: Fair Lending Cases Live On a Bit Longer

[...]the US Supreme Court's decision in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes1 spelled the end of fair lending class actions.2 Its decision in Texas Department of Housing & Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.3 then imposed significant evidentiary restrictions on such cases.4 This was followed by the Court's decision in Bank of America Corp. v. City of Miami,5 which ruled that municipal governments have standing to sue for discriminatory conduct by financial institutions under the Fair Housing Act (FHA), but limited recovery to injuries that are directly caused by such conduct.6 Two years later, the Eleventh Circuit has finally ruled on remand from the Supreme Court in the City of Miami case,7 but the guidance it gave to the lower courts is on hold due to petitions for rehearing.

 The Miami Gardens court's earlier rulings required the city to allege with considerable precision how it was injured by the alleged discriminatory conduct, how the injury was traceable to the conduct of the various defendants, and how the injury could be redressed by a favorable decision.55 Limited discovery on whether any loans issued between mid-2012 and mid-2014 violated the FHA and therefore were not barred by the statute of limitations produced a group of 153 loans of different types that were originated within the limitations period, including 130 loans made to minority borrowers and eight to non-Hispanic white borrowers.56 Miami Gardens' Rule 30(b)(6) representative, its city manager, testified that he could not identify any discriminatory or predatory loans, and that he could not identify any minority borrowers who received loans that were made on different terms than those made to similarly-situated white borrowers.57 The city's expert witness, whose testimony made up the heart of the city's case, matched two pairs of loans that he asserted showed evidence of discrimination.58 The bank's expert attacked the two pairings as not showing that the borrowers were similarly situated because they received lender credits to defray closing costs in exchange for higher interest rates and some promotional discounts.59 The Miami Gardens court ruled that the "core issue" was whether any FHA violations occurred during the FHA's two-year statute of limitations period, because if there were, the city could sue for earlier conduct on a continuing violation theory.60 Wells Fargo first argued that since the city was bound by its Rule 30(b)(6) representative's testimony and the city manager's testimony identified no discriminatory conduct, all claims were time-barred. Distinguishing a Ninth Circuit decision that suggested a contrary conclusion, the Oakland court found that the city's proffered statistical analysis linking the alleged discriminatory conduct to an increase in foreclosures and thus a loss of property tax revenue was sufficient to survive dismissal.95 But, the court dismissed the city's claim for municipal expenditures since no similar statistical analysis was proffered to support it.96 It did so without prejudice, allowing the city to amend if it could come up with similar substantiation.97 Wells Fargo challenged the city's third category of injury, its noneconomic injuries, for lack of Article III standing. Since there were no allegations that it was the bank's alleged discrimination, rather than general blighted conditions, that caused the city to divert resources to address housing discrimination, the Oakland court held that the city lacked standing and also dismissed this claim without prejudice.98 The Ninth Circuit has accepted an interlocutory appeal from this decision.99 There were also rulings in three cases filed by Cook County, Illinois that dissected the county's claimed injuries in light of City of Miami to determine which of the county's claims were viable in which the courts took a stricter view than the Philadelphia and Oakland courts took. In the first ruling, County of Cook v. Wells Fargo & Co.,100 the court dealt with allegations that Wells Fargo's equity-stripping practices targeted minority borrowers to a greater extent than non-minority borrowers with similar credit histories.101 Discrimination also allegedly "continued into the loan-servicing process," such as loan modification requests, managing workouts, and handling foreclosures.102 The county's alleged resulting injuries were the sheriff's direct costs for posting eviction and foreclosure notices; registering, inspecting, and securing properties; serving foreclosure case summonses; executing evictions; administering an increased number of foreclosure cases in the circuit court; increased demand for county services like housing counseling; reduced property tax revenue and other fee income; destabilization of minority communities; and increasing the likelihood that homeowners would have negative equity.103 The bank argued that "numerous intervening factors . could have contributed to the County's alleged harms,"104 so the Wells Fargo court checked carefully how direct the causation was for each category of injury.

WALMART TAKING COUNTIES TO COURT // Retail giant arguing Minnesota property assessors have violated its 14th Amendment right to equal protection.

Big-box retailers have mounted widespread legal campaigns to lower their property-tax bills in recent years, prompting courts to wade into the murky areas of market values and sometimes leaving counties in Minnesota and across the nation scrambling to cover lost revenue.

In Minnesota, such property-tax disputes — whether from individuals or megacorporations — have traditionally been waged in tax court, under a legal framework established by state law in 1935.

But in a new legal tactic, Walmart recently has begun to fight property-tax valuations on constitutional grounds, asserting that the longstanding state law shouldn’t apply.

The Bentonville, Ark.-based company filed challenges against at least four Minnesota counties this spring and summer on grounds that its rights of equal protection and uniformity granted under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution have been violated.

Adopted in 1868 as one of the Reconstruction Amendments after the Civil War, the 14th Amendment was originally crafted to address citizenship rights and equal protection of the laws to former slaves. The equal-protection clause is one of the most litigated elements of the Constitution, as it limits the actions of state government officials.

Lawyers for Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, have taken their case to Minnesota district courts, arguing that property assessors in Anoka, Martin, Wabasha and Washington counties “intentionally,” “willfully” and “systematically” discriminated against it compared to similarly situated properties in the same taxing district. The disparities led to an “unequal assessment” and overvaluation of its fair-market value, the retailer argues.

Walmart aims to reach back and contest six years of tax assessments, from 2013 and 2018, rather than being bound by the 84-year-old state statute, known as Chapter 278, which sets an April 30 deadline to file petitions and deals only with the current property-tax year.

The cases are in the early stages and outcomes could vary among different district court judges.

A judge in the Winona County case recently ruled against Walmart’s constitutional argument, saying in a Sept. 12 order that Minnesota’s Chapter 278 is the “exclusive remedy” for taxpayers to address unequal assessments, overvalutions and other claims.

“Taxpayers must seek protection of their federal rights by state remedies,” Judge Nancy Buytendorp wrote.

A decision by a different judge

in Martin County could come any day. Challenges in Washington and Anoka counties have not yet come before their district courts.

The basis for the fight isn’t new. Retailers — including Menards, Target, Lowe’s and Home Depot — routinely challenge tax assessments in communities across Minnesota and in other states where they do business.

Municipalities, which in many cases have offered retailers tax incentives to bring jobs and commerce to their communities, tend to incorporate sales and other measures of current business success into their market valuation. They use property taxes to keep libraries open, plow the snow, repair roads and hire police officers.

The companies base their legal claims on what has been called a “dark store” comparison, believing their properties should be valued based on what their brick-and-mortar properties would claim if sold on the open market. Because the stores have been designed for a specific purpose, they can have little value to other commercial enterprises when vacated.

The dark-store argument took root in the wake of the Great Recession and has expanded as the rise in e-commerce has led to closures of once-venerable companies such as Sears, Herberger’s, Kmart and Toys ‘R’ Us.

In Minnesota, dark-store challenges could lead to a potential loss of $70 million to $80 million a year in revenue to local and state governments, a Star Tribune analysis found.

Efforts to reduce tax assessments have continued even as businesses experienced significant reductions in federal taxes from the 2017 tax overhaul.

Nationwide, retailers are using the dark-store strategy to fight property valuations in at least 20 states, according to a report by City Lab.

Critics of the dark-store valuation approach model — which also has been used by food producers and manufacturers — said that reductions in retailers’ property taxes disproportionately shift the burden onto homeowners and small businesses.

Walmart’s approach in Minnesota seems to be an anomaly. By arguing on constitutional grounds, it seeks to move the fight out of tax court, which is an executive branch court established by the Minnesota Legislature to hear only tax-related cases.

Although all tax-court appeals are heard by the Minnesota Supreme Court, only a small number of cases go to trial each year.

In the Martin County case, as with the other counties, Walmart argues that the assessors have treated the company in a systematic and arbitrary way that runs afoul of the company’s constitutional protections.

In a complaint filed in the Fifth Judicial District, Walmart argued that between 2013 and 2018, its store in Fairmont faced a market value assessment “250% and 300% more than the average sales price paid or assessment for any big box store in Minnesota during the pertinent time frame.”

The 164,000-square-foot store opened in 2006. In 2018, Walmart paid $428,636 in property taxes to the county, according to government records.

At an Aug. 2 hearing, the attorney for Martin County argued that the state’s Chapter 278 law already meets the basic standards of due process and allows a fair opportunity for taxpayer challenges.

The law gives individuals and corporations alike the ability “to put the key in the courthouse door,” said Marc Manderscheid, a real estate law specialist with the Minneapolis firm of Briggs, on behalf of Martin County.

Walmart lawyer Edward Fox, of the Minneapolis firm Bassford Remele, countered: “What they are asking this court to do is to slam the courthouse door in our face.”

Argued Fox: “The tax court has no jurisdiction to consider constitutional claims.”

Judge Darci Bentz could make a ruling this week.

MIL-OSI Global: What Amazon, Walmart employees risk when they use the workplace for activism

It has somehow become sort of normal to use the workplace to protest social issues unrelated to the job itself. This was something almost unheard of even five years ago.

The latest example came on Sept. 20 as more than 1,000 Amazon employees staged a walkout over the retailer’s "inaction" on climate change.

In recent months, there has also been unrest among Walmart employees over gun sales and protests by Google and Microsoft workers over military use of their software. And of course, there’s Colin Kaepernick and other professional athletes who used the field - a football player’s office - to protest racialized police violence.

The workplace used to be the very last place you would want to bring attention to social issues, however important. That’s because the office or factory isn’t a democracy where activism is protected. To a workplace scholar like me, what’s really interesting is how employees are increasingly willing to undertake this risky form of protest - and how employers are adapting.

The risks of workplace activism

As a legal matter, there is a big difference between marching in the street - for example, as part of a climate protest - and walking off the job as part of that same protest.

Let’s say you have the day off, and you decide to join a march through the streets. The government can’t just arrest you or banish you to another country. Your activism is protected under the First Amendment.

Those rights fall away the minute you cross the threshold into your job. Unless the government’s your boss, you stop being a citizen and become a worker subject to your employer’s rule. There, you live in something of a "dictatorship, in which bosses govern in ways that are largely unaccountable to those who are governed," as philosopher Elizabeth Anderson puts it.

[embedded content]

Philosopher Elizabeth Anderson explains why the workplace is like a dictatorship.

You may think calling the office a dictatorship is an exaggeration, but in reality it’s not. Like a real dictatorship, you can be exiled at any moment for virtually any infraction. The vast majority of workers in the United States are employed "at-will," which literally means you can be terminated at any time, without notice, for any reason or no reason at all.

As a lawyer, I have written countless "at-will" provisions into contracts, and it’s not even strictly necessary. Courts will presume that you are "at-will" unless you present a mountain of evidence showing the employer intended to offer real job security.

If companies can fire you for any reason, that reason might include stirring the pot. And employers tend to respond to social activism the way the "Seinfeld" character George Costanza reacted when his friend Elaine tried to invite his fiance to the opera: by freaking out.

"Everybody knows," he shouts, "that you gotta keep the worlds apart!"

Work is for work. Save your activism for evenings and weekends.

[embedded content]

In ‘Seinfeld,’ Costanza panics when his social spheres converge, threatening his independence.

Weak workplace protections

Lawmakers and courts have long known that employers can abuse their power to fire workers. Over many decades, the law has developed to specify certain circumstances in which employers cannot retaliate against workers.

But the key here is that those exceptions are limited, and the law generally lags several years - or sometimes decades - behind what is happening in the workplace.

The law prohibits employers from firing workers where they are trying to advance or protect other key employment rights - like trying to organize a union or filing a gender  discrimination lawsuit. Courts will also protect workers who really had no choice but to act against their employer’s preferences - like when they are summoned for jury duty, or when their boss asks them to engage in illegal conduct.

Even whistleblowers who unearth illegal conduct have to walk a tightrope if they want to keep their jobs. For example, the anonymous national security whistleblower who complained about Trump’s alleged call with the Ukrainian president would have lost legal protection - and faced potential criminal prosecution - if he or she went straight to the press. The whistleblower could maintain protection only by complaining confidentially within authorized government channels.

[embedded content]

Law professor Richard Moberly discusses national security whistleblowers.

Activists out on a limb

Today’s social activists don’t really qualify as whistleblowers, though.

Whistleblower protections are designed to protect those who disclose important information about misconduct to corporate heads or government authorities. Like a sports referee, true whistleblowers are pointing out a violation that others overlooked. Social activists in the workplace, by contrast, lend their voice to a known cause.

In that sense, social activists are perhaps most closely analogous to employees who object to work assignments on religious grounds - a pharmacist who refuses to fill prescriptions for religious reasons, for example. But those workers are on much firmer legal ground, because Title VII of the Civil Rights Act requires employers to provide some accommodation for workers’ religious beliefs.

By contrast, employers can and do punish workers for activism they consider too disruptive or distracting.

That’s why Walmartapparently shut down network access for the worker who called for the gun-related walkout. It’s why Google issued a new policy, essentially telling workers to focus on their jobs; why U.S. Soccer imposed a ban on kneeling during the national anthem; and why Colin Kaepernick still has no contract.

Perhaps more surprising, though, is the ways in which companies have proved responsive to employee activism. Amazon let workers take vacation time to walk off the job and issued a carbon pledge. Google declined to renew a contract providing artificial intelligence to the military. Even Walmartdiscontinued some of its ammunition sales and is urging lawmakers to pass gun control legislation.

In a competitive labor market, it’s almost as if allowing employee protest has become a workplace perk of sorts, a special privilege companies selectively dispense for workers - software programmers in particular - who are hard to replace. Tellingly, far fewer store workers at Walmart walked off the job than salaried workers at Amazon’s headquarters. They may have sensed that Walmart would call their bluff.

But like all privileges dispensed by authoritarian rulers, the freedom to protest can be retracted at will. I would not expect it to survive the next downturn.

Who knew the humble tailpipe could cause so much political rancor? Find out why, below, along with more business and tech news that you should know heading into the week. On that note, check out our in-depth analysis of life in the modern workplace, including a guide to office chitchat and snacks. See, Monday doesn’t need to be so bad.

What’s Up (Sept. 15-21)

Tailpipe Debates

When President Trump decided a year ago to roll back Obama-era rules for car pollution, California shrugged, ignored him and kept its stricter regulations. Thirteen other states then followed its lead. The auto industry isn’t equipped to make different cars for different states, so it must adhere to whoever’s rules are the tightest — rendering Mr. Trump’s moot. Peeved, the president has now revoked California’s right to break with the federal government’s looser environmental standards. His order is in a legal gray area, and on Friday, California and nearly two dozen other states sued to block it. The ultimate decision will have an obvious impact on carmakers as well as air quality. Tailpipe pollution is the United States’ largest source of greenhouse gases.

Speaking of Car Problems

More than 49,000 workers at General Motorswent on strike last weekend to protest their pay, health care costs and job security. G.M. says it offered “best-in-class wages and benefits,” along with more employment opportunities, but the United Automobile Workers union wasn’t satisfied. The company has been making record profits for the past several years, and workers want to see more of those dollars in their paychecks. But they may be short on bargaining chips, as the union faces dwindling numbers and a federal corruption inquiry. Meanwhile, G.M. is eager to cut costs so that it can invest in new technologies like electric and self-driving cars.

Lower Rates Have Landed

Surprise, surprise: The Federal Reservedecreased interest rates by a smidge (a quarter percentage point), making it cheaper for Americans to borrow money. The decision was widely expected, and was meant to juice the slowing economy. But Fed officials are still sharply divided on how much the rate cut was needed, considering that the economy is still pretty robust — unemployment is low, people are spending and wages are on the rise. On the flip side, more hawkish economists (and Mr. Trump) want the Fed to cut rates more drastically to head off a potential recession. But no one can agree how much of a threat that really is.

What’s Next? (Sept. 22-28)

Trouble in the Kingdom

Saudi Arabia could take months to fully restore oil output after its biggest oil-processing plant was attacked last Saturday by … well, it’s still not entirely clear. The Trump administration blames Iran, whose government denies it. Meanwhile, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are backed by Iran, are claiming responsibility, but no one believes that they had the resources to pull it off. Either way, the attack has squeezed the world’s oil supply, and Saudi Arabia has tapped into reserves to keep it flowing. Here in the United States, Mr. Trump is threatening retaliation against Iran, although it’s unclear what that means. His top priority? Keeping oil prices down and the economy steady, which would be hard to do if tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia escalate further.

Walmart Quits E-Cigarettes

As the number of vaping-related lung illnesses keeps climbing, Walmartsaid on Friday that it would no longer sell e-cigarettes of any kind in its stores in the United States. (That is, after its current supply has sold out.) The action follows a federal initiative to ban dessert-flavored e-cigarette products, which are particularly popular among teenagers. For Walmart, it’s another example of taking corporate responsibility on a larger public issue. Earlier this month, the retailer announced that it would limit its ammunition and gun sales after a fatal shooting at one of its stores in El Paso, Tex. Also on Walmart’s docket: avoiding a potential discrimination lawsuit. Almost 200 female employees have claimed that they were paid less than their male counterparts from 1999 to 2011, and the company is working on a settlement offer.

Boris Johnson’s Big Moment

Now for the latest chapter in the Brexit saga: Britain’s Supreme Court is expected to make a decision this week about the legality of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament two weeks ago. If he gets the thumbs up, he’ll be allowed to push forward with his Brexit plan (or lack thereof) unencumbered by his political opponents. But if the court doesn’t rule in his favor, his leadership will be seriously compromised — along with Brexit itself. The current deadline for Britain’s departure from the European Union is Oct. 31, and without an agreement in place for border checks and trade procedures, the country could see skyrocketing food prices, import and export delays and goodness knows what other economic havoc.

What Else?

Airbnb, the online room rental company, announced that it would go public in 2020. Valued by private investors at about $31 billion, it will be one of the biggest public offerings since last spring, when a bunch of hot start-ups like Uber, Lyft, Pinterest and Slack hit the market. In related news, WeWork has delayed its I.P.O. after investors questioned its business practices and leadership, causing valuations of the company to plummet. Speaking of start-up ennui, more tech workers are seeking therapy — with the help of apps.

Business News: U.S. Says Bias Is Likely in Walmart's Pay --- Agency says retail chain possibly    discriminated  against 178 female workers

Walmart Inc. likely discriminated against 178 female workers by paying less or denying promotions because of their gender, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said in memos viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The EEOC documents ask Walmart and the women who filed complaints to come to a just resolution of the matter, which could include a settlement and changes to Walmart's practices, say labor lawyers. If Walmart and the women don't reach an agreement, the EEOC could file a lawsuit against the retailer.

The determination by the federal regulator marks a milestone in a nearly two-decade effort by current and former store workers to seek damages from the retail behemoth for discrimination.

In 2001, Walmart workers pursued a sprawling class-action suit against Walmart, alleging the retailer systematically paid 1.6 million female workers less than men and offered fewer promotions. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2011 the group had too little in common to form a single class of plaintiffs.

Since then, more than 1,900 women have pursued cases and filed charges with the EEOC against Walmart alleging sex discrimination, said Christine Webber, a partner at the law firm that argued the Supreme Court case on behalf of the women and has acted as co-counsel on the cases since then. The law firm shared the EEOC documents with the Journal.

The EEOC said for 178 women, there is reasonable cause to believe Walmart paid women less or denied women promotions, or both, because of their gender. The charges involve workers in more than 30 states.

The allegations are more than 15 years old and "not representative of the positive experiences millions of women have had working at Walmart," said Randy Hargrove, a Walmart spokesman. Walmart has urged the EEOC to move forward on the complaints for years, and told the agency it is willing to engage in the conciliatory process, he said. The majority of cause findings "are vague and nonspecific," and Walmart has asked the agency to provide details, he said.

Walmart has 1.5 million U.S. employees, making it the country's largest private employer.

A spokesman for the EEOC said the agency can't comment on investigations or the administrative process unless litigation is filed. Joe Sellers, head of the employment practice at Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, the firm acting as co-counsel for the women's filings, declined to comment on settlement talks.

The reason or pace at which the EEOC issues findings or pursues a lawsuit are unpredictable and can stretch for years, but it is rare for the regulatory body to issue such a large number of findings against a single company over a wide geographic area, labor lawyers say, referring to the 178 women.

"When there are cause findings the EEOC is fully engaged and there could be litigation" if the parties don't come to a resolution, said Kenneth Yerkes, partner at law firm Barnes & Thornburg LLP who often defends employers in labor cases and isn't involved in the charges.

When the EEOC issues findings across a large geography it could mean the agency believes problems were systemic, not due to a single bad actor, said Mr. Yerkes.

Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll assisted in filing claims with the EEOC for nearly 2,000 women against Walmart in the wake of the Supreme Court loss in 2011 and 2012. Over the years, a handful of those women withdrew their claims and some pulled out of the EEOC process to file lawsuits.

More than 1,700 women still have claims pending against Walmart with the EEOC, the firm said.

US retail chain Walmart has probably discriminated dozens of women in its stores in the USA, a body responsible for enforcing labour law announced on September 17, AFP reported. 

There are reasonable grounds to believe that the retail chain has paid less for equal responsibilities and functions to women, and has denied them promotions because of their sex, according to information by Wall Street Journal and the Commission for Equal Access to Employment.

The discriminatory practices involve 178 women working in Walmart supermarkets in about 30 US states. Walmart has defended by explaining that the allegations of these complainants dated back more than 15 years and were not representative of the positive experience of the millions of women who had worked at Walmart.

Memos from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) reviewed by The Wall Street Journal indicate that Walmart Inc. possibly discriminated against 178 women the company employed by paying them less or denying them promotions because of their gender. The documents call on Walmart and the women who filed complaints to work on a fair resolution, which labor lawyers say could include a settlement and changes to the large retailer's practices. The conclusions that the EEOC appears to have reached represent a major development in an effort by current and former Walmart workers over two decades to obtain compensation for their employer's discrimination. These workers were involved in a broad class action attempting to hold Walmart liable for systematically paying 1.6 million women workers less than men and offering them fewer promotions. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs had too little in common to be considered a single class.

Walmart is the largest private employer in the U.S. with more than 1.5 million employees.

Walmart Inc. likely discriminated against 178 female workers by paying less or denying promotions because of their gender, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said in memos viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

More than 1,700 women still have claims pending against Walmart with the EEOC, the firm said.

In one case, a female Walmart worker earned $5.65 an hour as a sales associate in 2002. Over the next two years she became a cashier, then a claims associate without a pay increase, says an EEOC document. In 2004 Walmart hired an outside firm to examine its pay structure and the worker received a raise of $1.91 an hour, said the document. At least 100 of the EEOC findings involve women who received pay raises in 2004 due to the pay structure review.

In 2004 Walmart made "wide pay administration changes that resulted in increases for both genders," said Mr. Hargrove, the company spokesman. "The fact that someone received an adjustment does not mean there's a case of discrimination."

In August, a Florida judge ruled against three female former Walmart workers in their discrimination suit, saying they didn't provide sufficient evidence to go to trial. Still, In the ruling, the judge wrote that "something was indeed rotten within the corporate culture at Walmart." The women have filed a motion for reconsideration.

"For some of these women, they have been waiting a long time to have some kind of evaluation of their claims and ultimate closure," said Mr. Sellers. "Our hope is that this sets the stage for resolution of these charges and others like them."

Agency says retail chain possibly discriminated against 178 female workers

Walmart likely    discriminated  against female workers, U.S. agency says

(Reuters) - Walmart Inc likely discriminated against 178 female workers by paying them less, denying them promotions or both, because of their gender, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said in memos seen by Reuters.

The agency urged Walmart and the women who filed complaints to come to a "just resolution," which could include a settlement and changes to Walmart's employment practices, after finding "reasonable cause" to believe there was gender discrimination. The memos were issued in July and viewed by Reuters on Tuesday after they were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart is the world's largest retailer and the largest private employer in the U.S. with a workforce of 1.5 million.

Walmart told the EEOC it was willing to engage in a "conciliatory process," though in most cases the agency's reasonable cause findings were "vague and non-specific," said Randy Hargrove, a Walmart spokesman.

The cases involved allegations that were more than 15 years old, he said, and were "not representative of the positive experiences millions of women have had working at Walmart."

Joseph Sellers, a lawyer for the women, said there were at least 1,600 similar complaints pending at the EEOC, accusing Walmart of discriminating against women in pay and promotions between 1999 and 2011. About 150 lawsuits against Walmart, covering the same time period, were pending in federal courts across the country, he said.

In 2011, Walmart convinced the U.S. Supreme Court not to let about 1.5 million female workers complaining about pay and promotions sue in a class action, with a majority of justices concluding the women had too little in common to sue as a group.

Sellers, who represented Walmart workers in that case, said the memos issued in July involve women who worked at Walmart stores in over 30 states. That suggests a broad pattern of pay discrimination rather than isolated instances that could be attributed to local managers, Sellers said.

The EEOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

If Walmart cannot reach a settlement with the women, the EEOC could file a lawsuit against the company or authorize the women to bring their own.

Sellers declined to comment on the status of settlement negotiations.

Walmart likely    discriminated  against female employees: WSJ

Memos from the EEOC, a federal regulator, show 178 women were likely paid less than men and were also denied promotions.

United States retail giant Walmart likely discriminated against scores of female employees because of their gender, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing memos by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) seen by the newspaper.

The report quoted the EEOC memos as saying there was reasonable cause to believe Walmart denied 178 women promotions, paid them less than their male counterparts, or both. The charges involve workers in more than 30 states, says the WSJ,

The EEOC documents reportedly request that the individuals who filed complaints and Walmart come to a "just resolution" over the matter, with failure to do so possibly resulting in the federal regulator filing a future lawsuit against the company.

EEOC's move marks a milestone in a years-long push by current and former Walmart workers to seek damages from the company for alleged  discrimination.

In 2001, employees of the company launched a class-action lawsuit that accused the retailer of paying some 1.6 million female staff members less than their male counterparts.

Since then, the WSJ reported, nearly 2,000 women have pursued cases against the company over alleged sexual discrimination.

190910211731394 But Walmart was quick to dismiss the report on Tuesday, with a spokesman for the company saying the allegations were more than 15 years old and "not representative of the positive experiences millions of women have had" as employees of the company.

Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the company has told the EEOC it is willing to engage in a conciliatory process.

Hargrove also said that in the vast majority of cases, the EEOC's reasonable cause findings are "vague and non-specific" even though Walmart has asked the EEOC to provide details on its findings.

With some 1.5 million US employees, Walmart is the country's largest private employer.

A spokesman for the EEOC said the agency couldn't comment on investigations or the administrative process unless litigation is filed, but an employment lawyer told the WSJ it was uncommon for the body to issue findings of such a scale against a single company over a wide geographic area.

When the EEOC issues findings of such a kind it could mean the agency believes problems were systemic, not due to a single bad actor, said Kenneth Yerkes, partner at law firm Barnes & Thornburg LLP.

Walmart is reportedly receiving federal pressure to resolve allegations it treated female store associates unfairly.

According to CNBC, a memo from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) finds reasonable cause to believe claims from 178 women who worked at Walmart stores in more than 30 states saying they were paid less than male coworkers and/or unfairly denied promotions.

Citing an original report in the Wall Street Journal, CNBC says the EEOC has been reviewing gender-based allegations against Walmart since 2012. The federal agency is reportedly urging Walmart to reach a fair settlement of the complaints or face possible lawsuit.

“We have told the EEOC that we are willing to engage in the conciliatory process with all the cases,” Walmart spokesperson Randy Hargrove told CNBC. “The allegations from these plaintiffs are more than 15 years old and are not representative of the positive experiences millions of women have had working at Walmart. Walmart will continue to respect the confidential nature of the process with the EEOC and will not be commenting on the individual cases.”

The EEOC declined a request for comment from CNBC. Read the entire article here.

Sept 17 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc likely discriminated against 178 female workers by paying them less, denying them promotions or both, because of their gender, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said in memos seen by Reuters.

The agency urged Walmart and the women who filed complaints to come to a "just resolution," which could include a settlement and changes to Walmart's employment practices, after finding "reasonable cause" to believe there was gender discrimination. The memos were issued in July and viewed by Reuters on Tuesday after they were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart is the world's largest retailer and the largest private employer in the U.S. with a workforce of 1.5 million.

Walmart told the EEOC it was willing to engage in a "conciliatory process," though in most cases the agency's reasonable cause findings were "vague and non-specific," said Randy Hargrove, a Walmart spokesman.

The cases involved allegations that were more than 15 years old, he said, and were "not representative of the positive experiences millions of women have had working at Walmart."

Joseph Sellers, a lawyer for the women, said there were at least 1,600 similar complaints pending at the EEOC, accusing Walmart of discriminating against women in pay and promotions between 1999 and 2011. About 150 lawsuits against Walmart, covering the same time period, were pending in federal courts across the country, he said.

In 2011, Walmart convinced the U.S. Supreme Court not to let about 1.5 million female workers complaining about pay and promotions sue in a class action, with a majority of justices concluding the women had too little in common to sue as a group.

Sellers, who represented Walmart workers in that case, said the memos issued in July involve women who worked at Walmart stores in over 30 states. That suggests a broad pattern of pay discrimination rather than isolated instances that could be attributed to local managers, Sellers said.

The EEOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

If Walmart cannot reach a settlement with the women, the EEOC could file a lawsuit against the company or authorize the women to bring their own.

Sellers declined to comment on the status of settlement negotiations. (Reporting by Daniel Wiessner and Jon Stempel in New York; Editing by David Gregorio and Bernadette Baum)

US authorities believe global retail giant Walmart likely discriminated against some female employees in US stores, paying them less or denying them promotions, according to a media report on Tuesday.

The Equal Opportunity Employment Commission, a federal agency charged with preventing workplace discrimination, found reasonable grounds to support the allegations, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cited EEOC documents.

The finding, which concerns 178 women across 30 states, comes after many years of efforts by workers to seek compensation for alleged discrimination.

Since a class action lawsuit failed before the Supreme Court in 2011, nearly 2,000 women have lodged EEOC grievances alleging sex discrimination by the company, The Journal said.

The newspaper cited documents provided by a law firm representing the women, which is calling on Walmart to reach a just resolution with the workers.

Walmart said Tuesday the complaints were old and comparatively few, given that the company has employed millions of women since 2004. The company also called the EEOC findings vague.

"We have told the EEOC that we are willing to engage in the conciliatory process with all the cases," the company said in a statement.

"The allegations from these plaintiffs are more than 15 years old and are not representative of the positive experiences millions of women have had working at Walmart."

The cases have been before the EEOC since 2012 and the company said it has urged officials to speed up the process.

With more than 1.5 million workers, Walmart is America's largest private employer.

Sept 17 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc likely discriminated against 178 female workers by paying less or denying promotions or both because of their gender, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said in memos reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, the newspaper said on Tuesday.

The agency urged Walmart and the women who filed complaints to come to a "just resolution," which could include a settlement and changes to Walmart's employment practices, after finding "reasonable cause" to believe there was gender discrimination, the newspaper said.

Walmart is the world's largest retailer, and according to the newspaper has 1.5 million U.S. employees.

Randy Hargrove, a Walmart spokesman, said Walmart told the EEOC it was willing to engage in a "conciliatory process," though in most cases the agency's reasonable cause findings were "vague and non-specific."

He also said the cases involved allegations that were more than 15 years old, and were "not representative of the positive experiences millions of women have had working at Walmart."

A lawyer who has acted as a co-counsel for women who filed complaints could not immediately be reached for comment.

In 2011, Walmart convinced the U.S. Supreme Court not to let roughly 1.5 million female workers complaining about pay and promotions sue in a class action, with a majority of justices concluding the women had too little in common to sue as a group.

More than 1,900 women have since pursued cases and filed charges with the EEOC accusing the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer of gender discrimination, the Journal said.

The charges involving the 178 women come from more than 30 states, and it is rare for the EEOC to pursue that many cases against one employer over such a wide geographic area, the newspaper added, citing labor lawyers.

An EEOC spokesman told the newspaper that the agency cannot discuss investigations or the administrative process until litigation is filed. (Reporting by New York Newsroom; Editing by David Gregorio)

The memo from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission shows that 178 female workers were payed less or denied promotions based on their gender

Walmart Inc.(WMT, US)  likely discriminated against 178 female workers by paying less or denying promotions because of their gender, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said in memos viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The EEOC documents ask Walmart and the women who filed complaints to come to “a just resolution of this matter,” which could include a settlement and changes to Walmart’s practices, say labor lawyers. If Walmart and the women don’t reach an agreement, the EEOC could file a lawsuit against the retailer.

The determination by the federal regulator marks a milestone in a nearly two-decade effort by current and former store workers to seek damages from the retail behemoth for discrimination.

In 2001, Walmart workers pursued a sprawling class-action suit against Walmart, alleging the retailer systematically paid 1.6 million female workers less than men and offered fewer promotions. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2011 the group had too little in common to form a single class of plaintiffs.

Walmart Inc. likely discriminated against 178 female workers by paying less or denying promotions because of their gender, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said in memos viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The EEOC documents ask Walmart and the women who filed complaints to come to "a just resolution of this matter," which could include a settlement and changes to Walmart's practices, say labor lawyers. If Walmart and the women don't reach an agreement, the EEOC could file a lawsuit against the retailer.

The determination by the federal regulator marks a milestone in a nearly two-decade effort by current and former store workers to seek damages from the retail behemoth for discrimination.

In 2001, Walmart workers pursued a sprawling class-action suit against Walmart, alleging the retailer systematically paid 1.6 million female workers less than men and offered fewer promotions. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2011 the group had too little in common to form a single class of plaintiffs.

Since then, more than 1,900 women have pursued cases and filed charges with the EEOC against Walmart alleging sex discrimination, said Christine Webber, a partner at the law firm that argued the Supreme Court case on behalf of the women and has acted as co-counsel on the cases since then. The law firm shared the EEOC documents with the Journal.

The EEOC said for 178 women, there is reasonable cause to believe Walmart paid women less or denied women promotions, or both, because of their gender. The charges involve workers in more than 30 states.

The allegations are more than 15 years old and "not representative of the positive experiences millions of women have had working at Walmart," said Randy Hargrove, a Walmart spokesman. Walmart has urged the EEOC to move forward on the complaints for years, and told the agency it is willing to engage in the conciliatory process, he said. The majority of cause findings "are vague and non-specific," and Walmart has asked the agency to provide details, he said.

Walmart has 1.5 million U.S. employees, making it the country's largest private employer.

A spokesman for the EEOC said the agency can't comment on investigations or the administrative process unless litigation is filed. Joe Sellers, head of the employment practice at Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, the firm acting as co-council for the women's filings, declined to comment on settlement talks.

The reason or pace at which the EEOC issues findings or pursues a lawsuit are unpredictable and can stretch for years, but it is rare for the regulatory body to issue such a large number of findings against a single company over a wide geographic area, labor lawyers say, referring to the 178 women.

"When there are cause findings the EEOC is fully engaged and there could be litigation" if the parties don't come to a resolution, said Kenneth Yerkes, partner at law firm Barnes & Thornburg LLP who often defends employers in labor cases and isn't involved in the charges. When the EEOC issues findings across a large geography it could mean the agency believes problems were systemic, not due to a single bad actor, said Mr. Yerkes.

"I think that it is unusual and potentially momentous and I think speaks volumes to Walmart's practices," said Lisa Banks, partner at law firm Katz, Marshall & Banks LLP who often represents potential whistleblowers and plaintiffs in high-profile employment discrimination and sexual-harassment cases and isn't involved in the claims. She was previously an attorney in the EEOC's appellate division.

Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll assisted in filing claims with the EEOC for nearly 2,000 women against Walmart in the wake of the Supreme Court loss in 2011 and 2012. Over the years a handful of those women withdrew their claims and some pulled out of the EEOC process to file lawsuits. More than 1,700 women still have claims pending against Walmart with the EEOC, the firm said.

In one case, a female Walmart worker earned $5.65 an hour as a sales associate in 2002. Over the next two years she became a cashier, then a claims associate without a pay increase, says an EEOC document. In 2004 Walmart hired an outside firm to examine its pay structure and the worker received a raise of $1.91 an hour, said the document. At least 100 of the EEOC findings involve women who received pay raises in 2004 due to the pay structure review.

In 2004 Walmart made "wide pay administration changes that resulted in increases for both genders," said Mr. Hargrove, the company spokesman. "The fact that someone received an adjustment does not mean there's a case of discrimination."

In August, a Florida judge ruled against three female former Walmart workers in their discrimination suit, saying they didn't provide sufficient evidence to go to trial. Still, In the ruling, the judge wrote that "something was indeed rotten within the corporate culture at Walmart." The women have filed a motion for reconsideration.

"For some of these women, they have been waiting a long time to have some kind of evaluation of their claims and ultimate closure," said Mr. Sellers. "Our hope is that this sets the stage for resolution of these charges and others like them."

Staff say they will no longer be given paid breaks

An Asda employee has said that staff members are being forced to work bank holiday Mondays and get unpaid breaks, under new contracts.

More than 1,000 Asda workers - who are members of the GMB Union - are taking part in planned strikes across the country, over the new so-called flexible contracts.

Under the new 'Contract 6' employees will be paid higher wages, but staff say they will no longer be given paid breaks, long service holidays will be lost and rota flexibility is being taken away, theManchester Evening News reports.

The night shift is also being shortened from an eight hour shift to 12am to 5am, which mean staff will lose out on pay.

Workers who have not agreed to the new conditions have been handed 12-week dismissal notices.

Science reveals the worst possible time to make a decision

A supermarket employee, who wishes to remain anonymous, said the higher rate of pay being offered does not reflect what staff are being told to give up.

He said: "They have taken away paid breaks, they have taken away long service holidays.

"We used to accrue holidays. After 10 years you get one day, 15 years you get one more - it goes up to 32 days.

"They have cut it down to 28 days regardless of how long you have worked. The most angry are long-serving colleagues.

"Now everyone has to work Bank Holidays if asked. If we have children we then lose a day's holiday. We have to take it off.

"Some colleagues are then losing up to eight days holiday.

"They have also removed break windows. Colleagues that work eight hours now only get one break instead of two."

The staff member said the most concerning aspect of the new contract was the lack of flexibility over the rota.

Workers will now only get four weeks notice if changes are made to their shifts.

He said: "A lot of staff are care givers, parents or students. To change the hours with just four weeks notice causes problems.

"There are people who are grandparents, they look after kids so their parents can go to work.

"They are not covered under any discrimination laws, if they were to move them around they are not protected under law."

Previously staff were given the option of signing the new-style contract, but he said it is now 'disgraceful' Asda are foisting it onto the workforce.

In the latest GMB ballot 93% of members rejected the contract 6 propsoals.

Asda have said the base rate of pay is being increased to £9 an hour and staff will also be given an annual bonus, colleague discounts and other benefits.

Supermarket bosses have also said Christmas, Boxing Day and New Year's Day working will remain voluntary and paid at double time.

An Asda spokesman said: "The retail sector is immensely competitive and it is important that we are able to serve our customers in the best way to meet their needs.

"This contract is about increasing the take-home pay of more than 100,000 retail colleagues, through an investment of more than £80m, and ensuring that everyone doing the same job is on the same terms and onditions.

“The overwhelming majority of our colleagues from across all our stores, including in Manchester, have signed onto the new contracts and while we appreciate that some of our colleagues find the changes more unsettling, we do not want any of them to leave.

"We understand colleagues have commitments outside of work and will not be asking them to constantly move the time they work, their days or departments.”

Under the new 'Contract 6' employees will be paid higher wages, but staff say they will no longer be given paid breaks, long service holidays will be lost and rota flexibility is being taken away, theManchester Evening News reports.

The night shift is also being shortened from an eight hour shift to 12am to 5am, which mean staff will lose out on pay.

Workers who have not agreed to the new conditions have been handed 12-week dismissal notices.

Science reveals the worst possible time to make a decision

A supermarket employee, who wishes to remain anonymous, said the higher rate of pay being offered does not reflect what staff are being told to give up.

He said: "They have taken away paid breaks, they have taken away long service holidays.

"We used to accrue holidays. After 10 years you get one day, 15 years you get one more - it goes up to 32 days.

"They have cut it down to 28 days regardless of how long you have worked. The most angry are long-serving colleagues.

"Now everyone has to work Bank Holidays if asked. If we have children we then lose a day's holiday. We have to take it off.

"Some colleagues are then losing up to eight days holiday.

"They have also removed break windows. Colleagues that work eight hours now only get one break instead of two."

The staff member said the most concerning aspect of the new contract was the lack of flexibility over the rota.

Workers will now only get four weeks notice if changes are made to their shifts.

He said: "A lot of staff are care givers, parents or students. To change the hours with just four weeks notice causes problems.

"There are people who are grandparents, they look after kids so their parents can go to work.

"They are not covered under any discrimination laws, if they were to move them around they are not protected under law."

Previously staff were given the option of signing the new-style contract, but he said it is now 'disgraceful' Asda are foisting it onto the workforce.

In the latest GMB ballot 93% of members rejected the contract 6 propsoals.

Asda have said the base rate of pay is being increased to £9 an hour and staff will also be given an annual bonus, colleague discounts and other benefits.

Supermarket bosses have also said Christmas, Boxing Day and New Year's Day working will remain voluntary and paid at double time.

An Asda spokesman said: "The retail sector is immensely competitive and it is important that we are able to serve our customers in the best way to meet their needs.

"This contract is about increasing the take-home pay of more than 100,000 retail colleagues, through an investment of more than £80m, and ensuring that everyone doing the same job is on the same terms and onditions.

“The overwhelming majority of our colleagues from across all our stores, including in Manchester, have signed onto the new contracts and while we appreciate that some of our colleagues find the changes more unsettling, we do not want any of them to leave.

"We understand colleagues have commitments outside of work and will not be asking them to constantly move the time they work, their days or departments.”

Living in fear: In wake of the El Paso shooting, Hispanic residents worry about their safety

History professor Kat Reguero-Vandeventer was on vacation when she read the news Aug. 3. A mass shooting had just taken place at a Walmart in El Paso, leaving 22 people dead and 26 injured. She was horrified.

“It took me a while psychologically before I was OK to go into a store again,” she said. “It was really scary. I know this happens, but this one hit home.”

Reguero-Vandeventer, an activist in the Hispanic community, said her fear was intensified because the shooter was targeting immigrants in what she called a “hunt.”

Authorities believe the alleged shooter from the Dallas-Fort Worth area posted a 2,356- word manifesto titled “Hispanic Invasion” on the website 8-Chan. Authorities said he was targeting Hispanic immigrants.

“These people that had everything to live for were just doing some last-minute shopping for back to school ... and they were gunned down,” Reguero-Vandeventer said. “I think that’s why it hit so hard. I was in la-la land on vacation, enjoying life, just going around doing my thing, and all of a sudden reality hit.”

Since the shooting, Hispanics across the country have been living in fear of falling victim to crimes because of their ethnicity.

Carlos Revelo, a government professor and political analyst with Univision, said the political climate before the shooting was already tense, but the shooting in El Paso heightened it to new levels. Revelo emigrated from El Salvador in 1980. He said in 40 years he has never had to be this cautious about his actions.

“I love this country as much as any native U.S-born American,” he said. “But this issue of immigration touches me close because I have an accent, because of my color and because of my exposure. So I can easily be the target, and I never felt that before.”

While he fears for his own safety, Revelo said he is more worried about his students. Some are DACA recipients and others are afraid for their family’s safety.

“I have to be on the look out, because you never know how you’re going to be perceived by someone that already thinks that I’m the problem,” he said. “If they [students] fear, I have to sympathize with them and tell them that I understand. That’s something I’ve never experienced before.”

Fernando Hernandez, who is working on an Associate of Arts degree, said the shooting was just another tragic event that has become normal.

“Well I was shocked, but at the same time, it was something that I found a bit predictable,” he said.

“Because it’s something that has happened a lot over the past few years and yet nothing has been done.”

Hernandez said laws to restrict gun purchases and high capacity rifle magazines should be enacted to limit the number of mass shootings. He also said the rhetoric of President Donald Trump gives people like the alleged shooter in El Paso an incentive to target members of mi- minorities.

Since his campaign began in 2015, Trump has been talking about an invasion of immigrants coming to America. His calls to build a wall along the Southern border to stop what he said was an influx of “criminals, drug dealers and rapists” from Mexico was a major part of his campaign. Last week the Trump administration diverted $3.6 billion from the Pentagon to pay for a wall.

Sociology professor Tasha Brown said that normalization and reoccurrence of mass shootings in America stems from a variety of factors, such as culture, value systems and leadership. She said the glorification of violence, easy access to weapons and corrupt ethos throughout the country are some of the factors.

“When you do not promote the message of acceptance, when you don’t promote the message of unity, when you don’t promote the value of diversity, well then people do not value those things,” she said. “Further, when you promote the lack of unity and diversity and it is OK to engage in prejudice, discrimination, etc., well then that does provide a reference point for some people in terms of how they can interact with society and other people.”

Guns and hate

In two years Texas has been home to two other deadly mass shootings. In November 2017, a shooter at a church in Sutherland Springs killed 25 people (and one unborn child) and injured 20. A shooting at Santa Fe High School left 10 dead and injured 10.

On Sept. 1, less than a day after a mass shooting in the Midland-Odessa area killed seven people and injured 22 others, new laws took effect that loosened restrictions on guns.

House Bill 1143 allows for guns and ammunition in school parking lots, as long as they are locked in a vehicle and out of plain sight. HB 1387 allows for more armed marshals in school districts.

Restrictions on guns in places of worship were also lifted during the legislative session. Senate Bill 535 allows for licensed handgun carriers to bring their weapons to places of worship, and HB 1177 allows anyone to carry a handgun without being charged with a crime in the days following a declared state of emergency.

Possessing firearms in homes is easier now with the passing of HB 2363, which makes it illegal for landlords or homeowners of rental properties to prohibit renters from lawfully carrying weapons on the premises. HB 2363 makes it legal for foster homes to keep guns in the house so long as they are locked in a safe.

A number of Texas lawmakers asked Gov. Greg Abbott to call a special legislative session to address the issue of gun violence following the shooting in El Paso.

On Sept. 3, Walmart announced it would stop selling ammunition for military style assault rifles, asked customers to not open carry in its stores and vowed to ask Congress to step up gun control measures, such as universal background checks. Kroger, CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens followed suit that week and asked customers to not open carry in their stores.

On Aug. 14, Abbott launched a Domestic Terrorism Task Force with the goal of countering acts of extremism in the state. The task force met for the first time Aug. 30 and, according to a news release from the governor’s office, is expected to meet quarterly or whenever called by the governor.

The news release said the task force will be “conducting investigations on criminal gangs affiliated with Neo Nazi and White Nationalist groups and networks espousing terrorist attacks.”

White nationalist groups had an increased presence on college campuses across the country. Research by the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism reported a 7 percent increase in white supremacy propaganda on campuses between Sept. 1, 2018, and May 31, 2019, over the same period from the year prior, which had 292 cases.

In July, the Dallas Observer reported that campuses across North Texas had seen the group “Patriot Front” passing out flyers and putting stickers on campuses in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, including at Brookhaven College. These groups have protections under the First Amendment to peacefully pass out flyers or leaflets on campuses, however public universities can control when, where and how groups recruit.

Call to action on campus

After the El Paso shooting, Eastfield’s Student Success and Wellness Division sent an email offering extra support from the counseling services and the Center of Equity, Inclusion and Diversity to any students who may be dealing with any type of problems associated with the shooting.

Katy Launius, dean of Student Success and Wellness, said the events in El Paso left an impact on her, and the idea to offer extra support to students came from that feeling.

“I think knowing that kind of hate lives in our community was a concern,” she said. “I can only imagine what it must feel like for our students. Then, knowing that the attack targeted Latinx folks, targeted immigrants, and knowing who our students are, that those are our students, that they might be thinking, ‘It could have been me.’”

Launius said she wanted people to know that her department is here for the “holistic well-being” of students. She also noted that it’s important for colleges to let their students know racist viewpoints are not necessarily the viewpoints of a college, but that those groups are allowed to peacefully participate in what she called “inflammatory speech” on campuses.

Counseling services on campus have not seen a rise in students coming in because of the events in El Paso, said Katie Neff, a licensed counselor on campus. She said people who are feeling a level of anxiety because of the shooting should seek counseling.

Neff also gave five tips for coping with emotions: seven to eight hours of sleep, a healthy diet, proper exercise, staying socially active and releasing emotions creatively or through meditation.

Mental health is not the only concern for students and employees.

Hevan Cathy, a childhood education major, said after seeing the news on Aug. 3 she thought about how easy it would be for something like the El Paso shooting to happen on campus.

“It’s not that I don’t feel safe, it’s just that it’s scary because of the fact that anyone can just walk in and out,” Cathy said. “It’s very open.”

She said the college could be taking better safety measures by enforcing the ID rule that began in April, which she said not many people follow. Cathy also said the college should make visitors wear guest passes and students should be better educated throughout the semester about the emergency procedures.

Emergency procedures are typically told to students at orientation, but not all new students attend.

There’s also a video located within the “Police & Safety” section of the school website that gives instructions on how to respond to college emergencies.

Brigham Wilcoxson, district emergency manager, said the problem with increasing safety measure is finding what he called “middle ground.” He said people have to take responsibility for their own safety now and suggested people watch the emergency procedure videos found on the district website.

“Have more situational awareness,” Wilcoxson said. “Go into a room and ask: ‘How could I best handle the situation if it were to happen in here?’”

District Police Chief Lauretta Hill also sent out an email after the shooting to remind people about the procedures in place if an active shooter came on campus.

I'm angry 29 dead over 50 injured in #elpasotexas and #daytonohio The rise of hate rhetoric in this country is fueling the loss of innocent lives. Call it out #WhiteNationalistTerrorism Thoughts and prayers are not enoughFaith w/out works is dead. #WakeUpAmerica

— Lauretta Hill (@commisshill) August 4, 2019

Hill stated in the email that all officers on campus have received the proper training to deal with an active shooter.

She said campus police receive active shooter training every two years and other emergency training on a regular basis.

“We’re trained, available and ready to respond to emergencies, and that’s what we train for in our jobs,” she said. “Our mission is to make a safe, accessible and welcoming environment for our students, faculty and staff, and they should have the confidence that we’re able to deliver that.”

For Reguero-Vandeventer, East-field feels as safe as any place. Whether she’s at the store, on campus or getting her hair done, the worry of being another statistic has been on her mind since the El Paso shooting.

“I can’t tell you when I’m going to wake up in the middle of the night and reach for my husband and make sure he’s still there because I had a nightmare or whatever,” she said. “I just try to live my life every day and be grateful for what I have.”
