International trade law could be the deciding factor as to whether local procurement targets can be imposed on Massmart, a condition that unions and the government want the Competition Tribunal to set if it approves the majority purchase of Massmart by Walmart.

After the hearings end on Monday, the tribunal will decide within 10 days whether to give a green light and if the deal will be conditional or not.

But conditions on procurement targets may not be an option, partly because some argue they cannot be measured or monitored and may fly in the face of trade agreements.

Jeremy Gauntlett, senior counsel for the merging parties, said when questioning Etienne Vlok of the Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers Union (Sactwu), that in terms of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, foreign entities could not be discriminated against in favour of local operations.

Gauntlett added that other trade agreements that South Africa was signatory to, including bilateral trade agreements, might also prevent a specific condition being placed on the local operation of a foreign company that did not apply to local competitors.

Mark Garden, a lawyer at Edward Nathan Sonnenbergs representing Massmart, said South Africa was party to bilateral agreements with the EU, China and the US, which were all potential sources of products. "It is an area that needs to be carefully examined. Potentially trade law could have an impact," Garden said.

But Vlok said WTO provisions on procurement did not apply to developing countries and other trade agreements would not be applicable.

Sactwu wants the deal prohibited, but if it is approved, it wants conditions imposed on the merged entity to protect local suppliers and their employees from job losses. This could materialise if Massmart, which will have access to Walmart's extensive global supplier base and its massive purchasing power, increases imports.

More than 90 percent of goods sold at Massmart stores, including Game, Makro and Builders Warehouse, are sourced locally, although actual local content, particularly in general merchandise, is far less as suppliers do import components.

Vlok said the welfare of consumers was not just about being able to buy cheap goods, but with increasing unemployment people needed income. "There needs to be a balance between achieving the cheapest price and protecting jobs."

A report by RBB Economics for the merging parties said that many products would not be imported even if they could be sourced cheaper internationally. This was due to the cost of transport and storage of bulky, heavy goods such as building materials, regulatory issues relating to phones and liquor, and the need to provide after-sales service and warranties, particularly on electronic goods, among other things.

Simon Baker of RBB Economics said there would be substantial consumer benefits from the transaction, including lower prices and an acceleration of Massmart's store expansion, which meant increased access for lower income consumers to cheaper goods.

Baker said prices could fall between 3 percent in the short term and 10 percent in long term. He added that there was no clear evidence that Massmart would replace local goods with imported goods.

Instead Massmart would benefit from Walmart's leverage with multinationals, more effective supply chain management, Walmart's position as the leading demand forecaster and its merchandising skills.

Gerhard Ackerman, the head of food buying at Shoprite, said the rival retailer would have to reciprocate if a competitor lowered prices.

"There is an option to buy cheaper products elsewhere but Shoprite has not gone this route as it needed to ensure the long-term sustainability of local suppliers," he said.

Walmart tries Africa as it hits walls in big American cities

Multinationals

FIVE decades after the establishment of Walmart — the world’s largest retailer with sales of $400bn, a little higher than SA’s gross domestic product — the company has saturated its traditional rural and suburban markets in the US, which are too depressed to generate decent growth.

It is looking to conquer two new frontiers: the US urban market, worth an estimated $100bn in potential sales, and international markets, where it has had limited success, according to a report published in American Prospect magazine.

But the push into large cities such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston and Washington DC — which account for 20% of the country’s buying power — has been met with fierce resistance from civil society coalitions that question the unacceptably high cost of Walmart’s everyday low prices.

Over the past six years, the company has become a master of & site battles& which are conducted like political campaigns. Walmart now positions itself as a green company that sympathises with & liberal& causes, but the world’s second-largest employer after the Chinese army still does not talk much about how it treats its 2-million workers. The cynics say the company’s strategy of paying workers so little they can only afford to shop at Walmart has backfired during the recession, as customers moved to cheaper stores, hence the need to support measures that give the working poor more money to spend.

However, in Washington DC, there are two anti-Walmart coalitions. Walmart-Free DC is opposed to the retailer’s entry under any conditions. Respect DC would allow Walmart to come in if the company signed a municipality-enforced community benefits agreement requiring it to pay living wages, permit unions and hire local residents.

According to historian Nelson Lichtenstein, the company has stores in 16 countries. & But income generated abroad is a much lower proportion of overall sales than it is at rivals Carrefour and Ikea, which are more adept at accommodating the culture of their host countries. Walmart is doing great in Canada but it failed utterly in Germany and South Korea, where it lost billions before pulling out,& he says. So Walmart turned to the gateway to Africa’s market of almost 1-billion consumers, SA, which became the location for its latest & site battle& In November, Walmart announced plans to buy 51% of retailer Massmart’s shares in a transaction worth about R16,5bn. The Competition Commission subsequently approved the transaction without conditions. Since then, a coalition of trade unions and members of civil society has raised objections to the proposed merger. At the end of February, the departments of economic development, trade and industry, and agriculture, forestry and fisheries intervened in the proceedings on the grounds that the commission had not sufficiently considered crucial issues relating to the public interest.

According to the Competition Act, the tribunal must consider the effect a merger will have on: a particular industrial sector or region; employment; the ability of small businesses, or firms controlled or owned by historically disadvantaged persons, to become competitive; and the ability of national industries to compete in international markets.

The tribunal must weigh the potential public interest benefits against the public interest costs. In the public debate, some analysts have emphasised the gains in terms of foreign direct investment. But the net inflow will be limited, as Massmart is already 72% owned by foreign shareholders.

The Walmart strategy is to hugely overstate the benefits of its business model. Recently, it commissioned a report that said between 1984 and 2005 it had saved US consumers $263bn, or about $2300 a household, and lowered the consumer price index by 3,1%. But the Economic Policy Institute said the report was inaccurate and deeply flawed. It had even credited the retailer with reducing prices it did not affect — such as services, 60% of the index basket.

Internationally, there is a growing volume of research that illustrates the high costs of Walmart’s low prices. The company has had a devastating effect on its employees, suppliers and their employees, local economic development and even the economy as the relentless drive to cut costs results in deindustrialisation as domestic output shifts to Asia, resulting in rising trade deficits.

The company, which refuses to recognise trade unions, has faced a litany of lawsuits for despicable employment practices — including discrimination against women and black people. It has been accused of wage theft due to systematic understaffing, which forces its associates — employees in Walmart-speak — to work off the clock without pay. The company’s associates earn 12,4% less than retail workers and 14,5% less than workers in large retail companies, according to one study.

Journalist David Moberg says there are well-documented stories of how Walmart dismantled iconic US consumer goods manufacturing businesses producing bicycles, padlocks, fans and lawn sprinklers. In each case Walmart kept demanding a lower price, at times challenging suppliers to match the price of cheap imports. They improved productivity, cut corners on quality, and pressured their own employees and suppliers, who in turn tightened their screws.

But, eventually, Walmart pushed these suppliers to China and any other place that could match the prices from China. From 1997 to 2004, US retail jobs grew more than half as fast as the population, and more than 70% of those new jobs were at Walmart. In that time, 3,1-million factory jobs disappeared. By 2003, more Americans were working in retail than in manufacturing. Walmart tripled imports from China. In 2004, it accounted for about 10% of all Chinese exports to the US, speeding up both US deindustrialisation and consolidating a low-wage, bargain-driven consumer culture where quality and price were both cheapened.

Moberg says: & The net effect of Walmart entering a local market is to: reduce local employment, area wage rates and total payroll (especially in retail); eliminate other businesses (especially small stores that compete with Walmart); and raise poverty rates.& Economist David Neumark reported in a 2007 study that, & on average, Walmart store openings reduced retail employment by about 2,7%& According to economist Kenneth Stone: & Between 1983 and 1993, Walmart opened around 45 stores in Iowa. During that period, the state lost 555 grocery stores, 88 department stores, 298 hardware stores, 444 apparel stores, 293 building supply stores and 511 other retail stores.& In SA, the entry of Walmart could have an equally devastating effect on Massmart employees, suppliers, local economic development and the economy. There is a risk of deteriorating worker conditions. And there could be a flood of imports to Massmart stores, comparable to an aggressive trade liberalisation, as Walmart uses its global purchasing power to source cheaper products and replace local producers.

As in Washington DC, the tribunal should consider one of two options — a prohibition (the Walmart-Free option), or the approval of the merger subject to conditions similar to the American community benefits agreements that Walmart has & signed all over the country& according to a spokesman quoted in American Prospect magazine.

* Workers of Cuban origin may pursue racial bias claim

* Wal-Mart says strongly disagrees with workers' claims

(Adds details on Dukes, Sam's Club settlement, stock move)

By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - Former Wal-Mart Stores Inc warehouse workers of Cuban origin may pursue a lawsuit accusing the world's largest retailer of discrimination, and of firing them when they complained about their treatment.

Monday's ruling by a federal judge in Chicago came as Wal-Mart awaits a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on whether female workers can continue pursuing what would be the largest class-action gender bias case in history against the company.

In the case of the Cuban workers, Rolando Padron, Bobirt Miranda and Eusebio Calzada accused Wal-Mart last October of paying them less and giving them different work schedules than non-Cuban workers, and denying them "make-up" days.

The men, each of whom had worked for Wal-Mart for more than five years, also said their supervisors ignored a half-dozen complaints before firing them in November 2006 in retaliation. They filed charges with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which found reasonable cause for a lawsuit.

Wal-Mart sought to dismiss the case, saying the men had no grounds to pursue a class-action case on behalf of Cuban warehouse workers nationwide, and had waited too long to sue.

While agreeing with most of Wal-Mart's arguments, U.S. District Judge James Zagel allowed the plaintiffs to pursue a claim under federal civil rights law alleging discrimination on the basis of ethnic characteristics.

Zagel rejected Wal-Mart's argument that because the EEOC charges were based on national origin discrimination and not racial discrimination, "the essence" of the plaintiffs' claim could not be discrimination based on ethnic characteristics.

"Plaintiffs allege that they have dark-colored skin, eyes and hair and that they are members of a racial minority, which could give rise to an inference of racial animus," the judge wrote.

Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Rossiter said: "We're pleased the court has dismissed important aspects of the case and we strongly disagree with the claims."

He also said the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company has strong policies against discrimination.

A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

A ruling in the Supreme Court gender bias case, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes, is expected by the end of June.

The Court is deciding whether that lawsuit, which has three named plaintiffs, can proceed as a class action on behalf of a group believed to exceed 1.5 million current and former female Wal-Mart workers.

If the Court rejects class-action status, women may still pursue their cases individually, lawyers on both sides of the case have said.

Last month, Wal-Mart's Sam's Club unit settled an ethnic harassment lawsuit filed by the EEOC, which alleged several employees of Mexican descent endured slurs.

Shares of Wal-Mart were up 43 cents at $55.53 on the New York Stock Exchange late Tuesday afternoon.

The case is Padron et al v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 10-06656.

By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - Former Wal-Mart Stores Inc warehouse workers of Cuban origin may pursue a lawsuit accusing the world's largest retailer of discrimination, and of firing them when they complained about their treatment.

Monday's ruling by a federal judge in Chicago came as Wal-Mart awaits a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on whether more than 1 million female workers can continue pursuing the largest class-action gender bias case in history against the company.

In the case of the Cuban workers, Rolando Padron, Bobirt Miranda and Eusebio Calzada accused Wal-Mart last October of paying them less and giving them different work schedules than non-Cuban workers, and denying them "make-up" days.

"Plaintiffs allege that they have dark-colored skin, eyes and hair and that they are members of a racial minority, which could give rise to an inference of racial animus," the judge wrote.

Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Rossiter said: "We're pleased the court has dismissed important aspects of the case and we strongly disagree with the claims."

He also said the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company has strong policies against discrimination.

A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

The case is Padron et al v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 10-06656.

A ruling in the Supreme Court gender bias case, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes, is expected by the end of June.

PRETORIA, South Africa, May 9 -- The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union issued the following news release:

A global coalition of trade unions will present its arguments on why Walmart should only be allowed to enter the South African market if it abides by certain conditions that will safeguard the economy and South African workers.

The South African Competition Tribunal resumes its hearings today on the proposed entry of Walmart into South Africa via the takeover of Massmart.

The global coalition of unions contesting the merger South Africa Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union (SACCAWU), UNI Global Union, and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) of North America will present evidence showing that the Tribunal should only allow the deal to go through if Walmart agrees to conditions on treatment of workers, union rights and sourcing products locally.

"We have prepared a clear case that shows that Walmart has a history around the world of suppressing union and worker rights," said Christy Hoffman of UNI Global Union, the worldwide union federation representing 20 million workers. "In countries where the company has not been legally obligated to accept a union, like the United States and Canada, it has brutally suppressed all of workers organising attempts. Even in countries where it was forced to accept a unionised workforce, Walmart has been attacking their rights every chance it gets."

The South African Government will join the union coalition in presenting its concerns about the impact of the merger of the size of the proposed Walmart / Massmart transaction on employment and competition.

The government has demanded that binding conditions be put in place to hold Walmart accountable to the promises it is making the South African people, including respect of trade union rights and existing collective agreements, job security, local procurement and support for small business, respect for the rule of law and non-discriminatory practices in order to ensure that the deal does not undermine the New Growth Path.

To demonstrate Walmarts devastating effects, SACCAWU in conjunction with the UFCW solicited written testimony from international economists and labour experts to submit to the Competition Tribunal. This includes a new affidavit from Kenneth Jacobs, Chair of the University of California Berkeley Centre for Labour Research and Education. Jacobs has studied extensively Walmarts effects on workers and the local communities where it operates in the United States.

"Given Walmarts well-documented history of violations of labour and employment law elsewhere," Jacobs said in his report, "if the Tribunal does elect to permit Walmart to acquire Massmart Holdings, Inc., conditions should be attached to the acquisition that would prove legal backing to Walmarts commitments to the Commission."

Jacobs says that Walmart has depressed retail wages in the communities it operates and in many cases has put more costs on taxpayers because its employees are more likely to need public assistance for healthcare and other costs. He also says Walmart's procurement model puts tremendous pressure on suppliers to cut costs, with the result that many suppliers have been shown to pay employees below the legal minimum wage or otherwise violate the law in order to meet the targets.

"In the United States, we have clearly seen the race to the bottom as the Walmart Model has come to dominate the industry," said Michael Bride of the UFCW. "The Competition Tribunal has the opportunity to stop this from happening in South Africa and to impose conditions that will protect economic growth."

The Tribunal hearings began in March but were postponed in order to allow the unions and government to share their evidence. Arguments will be heard for the next week.

Medicare and Medicaid; American Pharmacies Says Medicare Part D Laws Not Enforced

2011 MAY 9 - (NewsRx.com) -- American Pharmacies, a member-owned independent pharmacy cooperative based in Texas, is taking on Humana and Walmart via the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for discriminating against some pharmacies in Humana's new Medicare Part D prescription drug plan (PDP).

Humana, based in Louisville, Kentucky, is one of the nation's largest health insurers and has approximately 1.8 million Medicare Part D enrollees. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, is the world's largest retail chain. Together, as the insurance plan and the co-branded pharmacy, they are a formidable entity that CMS apparently is reluctant to make play by the rules, according to American Pharmacies General Counsel Amanda Gohlke Fields.

American Pharmacies is challenging the legality of the CMS regulations that led to the creation of the Humana-Walmart Preferred Rx Part D Plan, asking CMS to rectify it, in keeping with federal Medicare laws. "These ill-conceived federal regulations have fostered the creation of the Humana-Walmart plan," Gohlke Fields said. "Eliminating these regulations will ensure that any willing pharmacy may participate in any Medicare Part D plan.

"Against the will of Congress, the Humana-Walmart Preferred Rx Part D Plan favors Walmart-owned pharmacies and prevents all other pharmacies from being allowed to participate in the plan on equal terms," Gohlke Fields said. "All pharmacies must be allowed to participate in any prescription drug plan on equal financial terms.

"Those patients enrolled in the Humana-Walmart Preferred Rx Part D Plan must pay more for their medications simply because they want to consult a pharmacist with whom they have a long-standing, trusting relationship. Medicare laws call for a PDP to open its network of pharmacies to any pharmacy willing to accept the plan's terms and conditions. The Humana-Walmart Preferred Rx Part D Plan is no exception."

Fields also said American Pharmacy members are reporting misleading marketing issues, such as confusing formularies and inadequate disclosure of which pharmacies other than Walmart and Sam's Clubs are preferred providers. "Non-Walmart pharmacies are being hindered from serving those long-time patients enrolled in this PDP because of the preferred treatment of Walmart-owned pharmacies," she said.

This is not American Pharmacies' first bold step against a giant competitor. It filed a still-pending RICO suit against CVS Caremark in September 2010. That suit also followed inadequate action by a federal agency. A Federal Trade Commission investigation into the conglomerate's business practices has been dragging on for years, according to American Pharmacies and other community pharmacy organizations.

The CVS Caremark lawsuit, brought by six Texas pharmacies owned by members of the American Pharmacies board of directors, is a class action that could benefit all community pharmacies in the country. As a result, pharmacy associations and individual pharmacists nationwide are backing the CVS Caremark fight by sending financial support to the American Pharmacies Legal Defense Fund. American Pharmacies is a member-owned pharmacy cooperative operating in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Missouri, Mississippi, and Tennessee.

May 09, 2011 (UNI Global Union/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- A global coalition of trade unions will present its arguments on why Walmart should only be allowed to enter the South African market if it abides by certain conditions that will safeguard the economy and South African workers.

Wal-Mart rules again

FORTUNE -- Wal-Mart wins the battle for No. 1 for the second year in a row, knocking out its chief competitor for the title of America's largest company, Exxon Mobil.

The retail champ earned its place at the top with a staggering $421 billion in sales. And despite softness in the U.S. market and a nagging class action suit alleging sex discrimination that's currently before the U.S. Supreme Court, Wal-Mart's earnings jumped more than 14%, to $16.4 billion.

But while Wal-Mart has bragging rights, the real moneymaker is Exxon Mobil, no. 2 on the Fortune 500 this year. The oil giant rode soaring global oil prices to an astonishing $35.6 billion in profits-the most of any company on the list.

Fellow oil giant Chevron rounds out the top three with $196 billion in revenues, up 20%. More good news for Chevron: In March the company learned that it wouldn't have to pay billions in compensation to Ecuadorian citizens' groups who had sued Chevron's precursor company, Texaco, for environmental damage.

Berkshire Hathaway jumped four places on our list, to No. 7. Revenues at the giant holding company rose by 20% to $136.2 billion. This should be some consolation to CEO Warren Buffett, who faced unaccustomed bad press recently after it emerged that heir apparent David Sokol had bought stock in a company that he then urged Berkshire to acquire. (Sokol has since resigned his post at Berkshire.)

There was also action farther down the list, as pharmaceutical stalwart Pfizer moved up nine places, to No. 31. Pfizer's earnings dropped 4.4%, though, and the company's board abruptly replaced CEO Jeff Kindler in December after five years of sluggish stock performance. With its patents for Lipitor and other blockbuster drugs about to expire, Pfizer needs to crank up its innovation engine.

DirecTV (No. 110) jumped six places on the list as revenues rose by almost 12%, to $24.1 billion. Driven by rapid growth in its Latin America division, the pay-TV provider's profits more than doubled. CEO Mike White announced that DirecTV added 1.9 million net new subscribers in 2010, its second-best year ever.

This year's list has a few oddities: Automaker General Motors rose to No. 8, despite having emerged from bankruptcy only in November. And two homebuilders made the list despite a national foreclosure crisis. Then there's that destitute ward of the government, Fannie Mae, which lost more than $14 billion last year but sprang to No. 5 on the 500, ahead of General Electric. Why? Mostly due to new accounting rules.

All told, the Fortune 500 generated nearly $10.8 trillion in total revenues last year, up 10.5%. Total profits soared 81%. But guess who didn't benefit much from this giant wave of cash? Millions of U.S. workers stuck in a stagnant job market.

Sure, these corporate profits derived partly from productivity gains, including workforce reductions. And many 500 companies are growing faster overseas than in the U.S. Nevertheless, we've rarely seen such a stark gulf between the fortunes of the 500 and those of ordinary Americans.

All eyes are on the U.S. Supreme Court in a case that involves millions of female employees facing off against the nation's largest retailer. In March, the justices heard arguments in the most closely watched case before the Court this year, and the largest employment class action in history, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes.

Betty Dukes, along with several other current and former employees of the superstore, filed an action in the District Court for the Northern District of California in 2001 alleging that the chain engaged in discriminatory pay and promotion practices adversely affecting women. They sought money damages, as well as an injunction ordering Wal-Mart to cease and desist such practices. A class was certified including between 500,000 and 1.5 million current and former employees, making it one of the largest class actions in U.S. history. The class includes all women who have worked for the retail giant since 1998. It was certified by the District Court and upheld by the en banc 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

Specifically, the plaintiffs allege that women employed in Wal-Mart stores are paid less than their male counterparts holding comparable positions, and despite having higher performance ratings and greater seniority. Additionally, they claim that women receive fewer, and wait longer for, promotions to management-level positions.

In seeking class certification, the plaintiffs claimed that the retailer's internal structure promotes discrimination and stereotyping on the basis of sex, that such practices are consistent throughout Wal-Mart's national sphere and that this discrimination affects all women who have ever been employed by the retail giant. The effect, they claim, is that companywide men are paid on average 5 to 15 percent more than women, or an average of approximately $5,000 more per year.

For its part, Wal-Mart contends that the case has grave procedural flaws. It asserts that the named plaintiffs have little in common with one another, let alone the remaining million-plus women who make up the class. It further contends that there is no statistical difference in pay between men and women at 90 percent of its stores, where the plaintiffs claim the relevant employment related decisions are actually made.

Despite the extensive media hype the case has received, the Court will not decide whether Wal-Mart is guilty of discrimination. Rather, the Court must decide whether the small group of plaintiffs has satisfied federal class-action rules, allowing them to stand for co-workers nationwide who they say have suffered under common discriminatory practices. Specifically, it has been asked to answer whether claims for monetary relief can be certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). The Court has taken up the question, sua sponte, under what circumstances and whether the class certification ordered under rule 23(b)(2) was consistent with rule 23(a).

Multi-Factor Test

To be certified, a class must meet various requirements. Namely, it must show that joinder of all class members would be impracticable, that class members share common questions of law or fact, that claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims and defenses of the class, and that the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.

In addition to meeting these requirements, the class may be certified only if "the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief... is appropriate respecting the class as a whole." Class certification under this provision does not extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominately to money damages.

That raises considerable problems for this class because, in addition to seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, the plaintiffs also want potentially billions of dollars in back pay. The 9th Circuit, however, affirmed the class based upon its application of a new multi-factor predominance test which considers several factors to determine whether monetary damages "predominate" over the injunctive relief.

The unprecedented nature of the case, and the Court's anticipated decision, has drawn an outpouring of competing briefs from corporate America and the nation's leading civil rights groups.

Many feel that class actions are an imperative instrument in holding corporations accountable for widespread, institutional bias. As such, the legal implications of the case are significant. If the Court denies the class the right to proceed, the ability of employees to fight institutional bias will, no doubt, be severely hampered. As a matter of course, an individual discrimination action has vastly less impact on a corporate employer, particularly one with Wal-Mart's size and global reach. Individual employees have fewer financial resources to devote to the battle and discovery in such cases is limited, such that company-wide patterns are often missed.

Conversely, there are obvious practical problems with certifying such a massive class, such as managing the litigation and calculating damages. Additionally, many feel that class certification is unfair and inappropriate, where such litigation involves countless individual employment decisions. It effectively denies an employer the right to present defenses with respect to how individual employees were actually treated, or to provide the basis for particular employment decisions in light of relevant facts and circumstances.

Pundits are also watching the Court closely for reasons unrelated to the litigation itself. The Court has been criticized by leading civil rights groups, Democratic leaders, and even the president himself for being too friendly toward big business. A ruling in favor of the corporate giant would, no doubt, do little to quell their consensus.

Equally notable is the current gender makeup of the court, one-third female for the first time in history. Many feel that the plaintiffs' claims of institutional gender bias will resonate with Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Ginsburg has a notable history on women's rights issues. It was she who delivered the opinion of the Court in United States v. Virginia, holding that the Virginia Military Institute's male-only admission's policy violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Similarly, it was her dissenting opinion in the landmark case of Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., which later formed the basis of the law reversing the Court's opinion favoring a 180-day time limitation in pay discrimination claims.

On a broader scale, the gender wage gap is anything but unique to Wal-Mart. According to the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, women who worked full time in 2009 in wage and salary jobs had median weekly earnings of 20 percent less than their male counterparts—though such statistics varied widely by industry.

Corporate America and its counsel will, no doubt, be on the edge of their seats until the Court reaches a decision, which is expected by the end of June.

THE WAL-MART ECONOMY
It's Alive!

If Wal-Mart is a person, as the Supreme Court contends, its a behemoth terrorizing the countryside-yet curiously immune, the company argues, from lawsuits.

What is Wal-Mart- in a strictly taxonomic sense, that is? Based on size alone, it would be easy to confuse it with a nation: In 2002, its annual revenue was equal to or exceeded that of all but 22 recognized nation-states. Or, if all its employees- 1.4 million in the U.S. alone- were to gather in one place, you might think you were looking at a major city. But there is also the possibility that WalMart and other planet-spanning, centibiDion-dollar enterprises are not mere aggregations of people at all. They may be independent life-forms- a species of super-organisms.

This, anyway, seems to be the takeaway from the 2010 Citizens United decision, in which the Supreme Court, in a frenzy of anthropomorphism, ruled that corporations are actually persons and therefore entitled to freedom of speech and the right to make unlimited campaign contributions. You may object that the notion of personhood had already been degraded beyond recognition by its extension, in the minds of pro-life thinkers, to individual cells such as zygotes. But the court must have reasoned that it would be discriminatory to let size enter into the determination of personhood: If a microscopic cell can be a person, then why not a brontosaurus, a tsunami, or a multinational corporation?

But Wal-Mart's defense against a class action charging the company with discrimination against its female employees- Dukes v. Wal-Mart- throws an entirely new light on the biology of large corporations. The company argues that with "7 divisions, 41 regions, 3400 stores and over one million employees" (in the U.S., as of 2004, when the suit was first launched), it is "impossible" for any small group of plaintiffs to adequately represent a "class" in the legal sense. What with all those divisions, regions, and stores, the experiences of individual employees are just too variable to allow for a meaningful "class" to arise. Wal-Mart, in other words, is too big, too multifaceted and diverse, to be sued.

So if Wal-Mart is indeed a person, it is a person without a central nervous system, or at least without central control of its various body parts. There exist such persons, I admit- whose brains have lost command over their voluntary muscles- but they are in a tiny minority. Surely, when the Supreme Court declared that corporations were persons, it did not mean to say "persons with advanced neuromuscular degenerative diseases."

For those who have never visited more than one Wal-Mart store, let me point out that the company is not a congeries of boutiques run by egotistical retailing divas. True, there are detectable differences between stores. Some feature Wal-Mart's indigenous "Radio Grill," famed for its popcorn chicken; others offer McDonald's or Subway. But other than that, every detail, from personnel policies to floor layout, is dictated by corporate headquarters in Bentonville.

An example: In 2000, I worked for three weeks in the ladies' wear department of a Wal-Mart in Minnesota. (Full disclosure: This makes me part of the class now suing Wal-Mart for sex discrimination, though the possibility of an eventual payout in the high two-figure range has not, I think, influenced my judgment on these matters.) In the course of my work, I made a number of sensible suggestions to my supervisorfor example, that the plus-size women's jeans not be displayed at what was practically floor-level, where plus-size women could not reach them without requiring assistance to regain altitude. Good idea, my supervisor said, but it was up to Bentonville to determine where the jeans, like all other items, resided.

Much has changed since my tenure at Wal-Mart. The company has struggled to upgrade its image from sweatshop to a green and healthful version of Target. It has vowed to promote more women. But one thing it hasn't done, as far as anyone knows, is to reconfigure itself as an anarchist collective. Bentonville still rules absolutely, over both store managers and "associates," which is the winsome Wal-Mart term for its chronically underpaid workers, some of whom report that they are still being forced to work off the clock, for no pay at all, just as I found in 2000.

So if Wal-Mart is a life-form, it is an unclassifiable one, at least in ordinary terrestrial terms. It eats, devouring acre after acre and town after town. It grows without limit, sometimes assuming new names- Walmex in Mexico, Asda in the U.K.- to trick the unwary. Yet in its defense in the Dukes v. Wal-Mart suit, Wal-Mart claims to have no idea what it's doing. This could be a metaphor for capitalism or perhaps a sign that a successful alien invasion is in progress. The only thing that's for sure is, should the Supreme Court decide in favor of Wal-Mart, we'll have a lot more of these creatures running around: monstrously oversized "persons" who insist that they can't control their own actions,

[...] Wal-Mart's defense against a class action charging the company with discrimination against its female employees- Dukes v. Wal-Mart- throws an entirely new light on the biology of large corporations. The company argues that with "7 divisions, 41 regions, 3400 stores and over one million employees" (in the U.S., as of 2004, when the suit was first launched), it is "impossible" for any small group of plaintiffs to adequately represent a "class" in the legal sense.

What the unions have learned-and what they may still need to learn-about fighting Wal-Mart's expansion

"Be very careful who you let into your neighborhood," Sandra Carpenter, a former Wal-Mart grocery manager from Maryland, warned New Yorkers considering whether to bring Wal-Mart to their town. "They will promise you everything under the sun," she said at a recent anti-Wal-Mart rally outside New York City Hall, "but at the end of the day, they will take it all back."

Wal-Mart's high-profile effort to expand into some major urban markets has suddenly cast a spotlight on the experiences of Wal-Mart workers like Carpenter and launched a battle that both Wal-Mart and the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), the union that represents grocery workers, badly need to win.

We've seen this fight before. Six years ago, Wal-Mart tried hard to break ground in Chicago, New York, Washington, D.C., and other cities. Opposition was fierce, and the battles were bruising for both Wal-Mart and its opponents- revealing institutional and political weaknesses on both sides. This round promises to do the same.

The last wave of expansion battles, particularly in Chicago, where Wal-Mart won approval to build several stores, revealed ineffectiveness and division in the labor movement. Once Wal-Mart agreed to build those stores using union construction crews, the Chicago building trades unions supported Wal-Mart's entry into the city - a deal that struck much of the local labor movement as a tremendous betrayal. The deal also revealed how little influence labor has over Democratic-elected officials in some nominally Democratic cities. Mayor Richard Daley vetoed a bill that would have forced Wal-Mart to pay $13 per hour as a condition of operating in Chicago- the sole veto of his epic, Mubarak-esque mayoralty.

Worse, Wal-Mart was able to focus public attention on one of labor's imperfections: At a time of declining membership, union contracts are not always that good. Wages for some UFCW workers in Chicago, contends Wal-Mart's director of community affairs, Steve Restivo, were no better than those for Wal-Mart workers. UFCW officials and academics who have studied Wal-Mart acknowledge that wages for new workers and part-timers in unionized stores may not be very high but note that unionized supermarket workers see their wages and benefits increase as they accumulate seniority on the job, which is not the case for longtime WalMart workers. The company has consistently declined an invitation from New York UFCW locals to have the state controller audit its records to ascertain its actual wage levels. Nonetheless, Restivo says that Wal-Mart scored a publicrelations success by publicizing the low wages paid to new hires in some unionized stores. "We were aggressive in telling that story in Chicago, Restivo says.

Understandably, this is a strategy of last resort for Wal-Mart, since the company would presumably not prefer to be dragged into a discussion of its everyday low wages. Even now, Restivo does not want to speak of "minimum" or "living" wages; he prefers words like "prevailing" or "competitive." But to fight Wal-Mart, the UFCW is going to have to become a more aggressive and strategic union, one in which nobody has a contract with WalMart-level wages and everyone knows the value of a union card. Some locals are more effective than others, and the one in Chicago wasn't one of them. Another, related lesson of Chicago was that a union has to be able to mobilize its members. Dorian Warren, a political science professor at Columbia who was involved in the 2005 Chicago site battles and is now working with Jobs With Justice to keep Wal-Mart out of New York, says the local's attitude in Chicago was "definitely don't organize the members, or they could organize against you." That kind of thinking has to change.

But the battles have revealed WalMart's weaknesses, too. Since most development in New York is, to say the least, not constrained by any democratic processes, Wal-Mart, in 2005, didn't feel it had to make a case to New Yorkers. This turned out to be a gross miscalculation; the City Council was so angered by Wal-Mart's arrogancein not showing up to City Council hearings on its proposed store- and disturbed by the retailer's record on workers' rights issues, including sex discrimination, that elected officials actually warned Vornado Realty Trust, the developer, to expect trouble with its other projects if it let Wal-Mart into its new mall in Queens.

Five years later, as it again seeks to enter the New York market, Wal-Mart apparently hasn't learned from its 2005 rebuff: The company still doesn't show up to City Council hearings, preferring instead to denounce the democratic process-which has included testimony from former Wal-Mart workers and academics who have studied the company- as a circus. Members of the council are becoming irked, and even XheNew York Post (which, as the leading source of right-wing populism in the New York area, should be this retailer's best friend) mocked Wal-Mart's no-show performance with a picture of an empty chair and the headline, "Empty seats are hard-sell."

In some ways, however, the company is in a better political position now than it has been in the past. Says Restivo, in an implicit admission of past sins, "We're a better company than we were four years ago." He points to some undeniably impressive facts, such as the company's dramatic reduction in greenhouse gases.

The company still has a major political problem, though, that won't go away no matter how slick its spokespeople or how green its lightbulbs. Jennifer Stapleton, assistant director of the UFCW's Making Change at Wal-Mart campaign, points out, "Wal-Mart wants to talk about everything else that the progressive community cares about but not how it treats workers." That open wound- Wal-Mart's treatment of its own employees- has festered, and this time around, it may expose the company to even more criticism. With Wal-Mart the largest private employer in the nation, an awful lot of people have now worked for the retailer, and many of their stories are devastating. Former and current WalMart workers seem to be more involved in these urban-site battles than they've ever been before. In addition to Sandra Carpenter, several other Wal-Mart employees spoke at the New York City Council hearing. Ernestine Bassett, who still works for Wal-Mart, spoke harrowingly of being denied bathroom breaks; a diabetic, she needs these breaks not just for the usual reasons but in order to give herself insulin shots.

Wal-Mart emerged from those 20052006 battles with one store in Chicago; a second was approved last summer, and Wal-Mart plans six more by 2013. The retailer failed to win entry to New York City or Washington, however. Wal-Mart retreated for a time, but now, out of economic necessity, it's back in the game of urban politicking.

The difference between four years ago and now is the Great Recession.

For Wal-Mart, the economic downturn has reduced the purchasing power of its patrons, making it more imperative than ever to expand its revenues by entering the big urban markets from which it's been excluded. For the UFCW and its community allies, however, economic hard times make it more difficult to keep Wal-Mart out. The urban poor are far more desperate for jobs and low prices. Wal-Mart has dramatically escalated charitable giving in the cities it's trying to enter, especially to organizations fighting hunger- a problem that has taken on new urgency with so many out of work. It has also aggressively courted black communities in Washington, D.C., underwriting the city's Black History Month programs in February and giving generously to schools that serve primarily black students.

For all of those reasons, some urban communities may be more willing to cut a deal with Wal-Mart than they were last time around. It is pretty easy to promise "competitive" wages in neighborhoods with more than 20 percent unemployment- there isn't any "competition." The fact that the company has been positioning itself as more socially conscious in recent years and has hired much better public-relations people may help persuade educated urbanités who don't have close ties to workers. Wal-Mart has aimed to buy off Washington, D.C.'s liberal establishment with surprising contributions to liberal think tanks like the Center for American Progress and Demos (with which the Prospect is affiliated) and unsurprising contributions to environmental groups like the Earth Day Network. In Boston, it has made a sizable donation to Harvard. And, as if aiming to provide fodder for comedians, the company, which is still the target of the largest sex-discrimination suit in history, has also made a donation to a group called Women Work! The National Center for Women's Employment.

Wal-Mart is also making strategic political donations, including to D.C. City Council Chair Kwame Brown, whom the company probably didn't need to buy since he worked in WalMart management for three years. Brown supports Wal-Mart coming to town, with some mild concessions to the community. Washington, meanwhile, is home to not one but two anti-Wal-Mart coalitions. One- Wal-Mart Free DC- is opposed to Wal-Mart's entry into Washington under any conditions. "We don't want Wal-Mart anywhere, ever," says Nkrumah-Ture, who briefly worked for Wal-Mart many years ago. The other, Respect D.C., a coalition backed by the UFCW's Washington local, would allow Wal-Mart to come in if the company signed a municipally enforced community benefits agreement (CBA) requiring it to pay living wages, permit organizing, and hire local residents.

Wal-Mart, however, doesn't see any difference between the two camps. Restivo says that Wal-Mart will agree only to "prevailing," not "minimum" wage standards and won't agree to allow workers to form a union. Any CBA that the UFCW would agree to, then, is off the table. While Restivo says that Wal-Mart has signed CBAs "all over the country," including at its stores in Chicago, none of them are legally binding. Neither do they commit the company to anything that goes beyond its normal labor practices. For its store in the Pullman neighborhood of Chicago, scheduled to open in 2013, Wal-Mart agreed to "make a goodfaith effort" to offer employee discounts and to bring new jobs and tax revenues to the area. Not a word about permitting union organizing or meeting specific wage standards. The Pullman CBA states that wages will be "competitive"as almost all wages are in a market-based system.

Still, the cities where Wal-Mart wants to open stores- which also include Minneapolis, Boston, and many more- have millions of consumers, and Wal-Mart can't necessarily afford to blow off all their demands. The recession has changed the game for Wal-Mart, perhaps even more than for its opponents. Years ago, retail analysts probably would have predicted that recession- and weak recoverywould be great for Wal-Mart. After all, recessions produce a lot of poverty, and the poor have been Wal-Mart's best customers. But it hasn't worked out that way.

With unemployment high, Wal-Mart's core customers have become simply too poor and too frugal to do much shopping. The retailer has been losing out to dollar stores, where one can make smaller purchases: The poor are becoming too poor to buy in bulk. As fuel costs become a daily nail-biter for so many, it's also important that the dollar stores are more easily reached on foot or by bus. Wal-Mart's sales have been lagging; the retailer's February earnings report disappointed expectations on Wall Street that were already low. On top of these recent woes, financial analysts have agreed for some time that Wal-Mart has saturated rural and suburban America, that efforts to expand overseas haven't gone well, and that the company needs new markets. Urban America is the only place left for Wal-Mart to grow.

The company's business model has run its course, insist many at the UFCW, and the company has to be in these urban markets now. Pat Purcell of New York's Local 1500 says, "Last time [coming to New York] was, on Wal-Mart's part, a desire. This time it's a need."

To be sure, Wal-Mart is no stranger to cities. The retailer has operated for years in such nonunion bastions as Dallas, Houston, and Atlanta. But there are major, and more unionized, cities in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and on the West Coast that the company has to crack. WalMart needs urban America. But its progressive, labor, and smallbusiness opponents hope to prove that it's not mutual- that urban America doesn't need Wal-Mart.

Wal-Mart's predicament has the ring of an Aesopian morality tale. The retailer's business practices have contributed to the immiseration of the American working class. Its relentless price pressure on manufacturers drove even more of them overseas, and the jobs with them. Wal-Mart's low wages and staunch opposition to unions helped keep wages low in retail, a sector so large it can affect the wages in other industries. As many have noted, Wal-Mart seemed to be pursuing a kind of reverse Fordism. While Henry Ford thought he needed to pay workers well enough that they could buy his products- cars- Wal-Mart liked to pay workers badly enough that they could only afford to shop at Wal-Mart. But today, Wal-Mart's own practices of reducing incomes to poverty levels may actually be hurting the company. Some at the UFCW wonder if now, improving the lot of the working class is actually in Wal-Mart's self-interest. Could WalMart's interests eventually align with labor? A massive increase in the minimum wage, the extension of unemployment benefits- all these tamely social democratic measures now could benefit Wal-Mart by giving the working poor a little more money to spend. So might more widespread union membership.

Restivo loves to say that Wal-Mart won in Chicago when its approach to the community changed from "transactional to transformational." That has a nice ring to it. But he is not, apparently, referring to a real transformation of the company's own management philosophy. When I ask Restivo if allowing union organizing at Wal-Mart might actually be in the company's interests, he insists that WalMart employees have always "chosen" to reject union representation.

Wal-Mart has a curious idea of "choice," judging from the stories of former employees like Kenneth James, a former Wal-Mart associate of the month, who gave testimony at the New York City Council hearing. After James tried talking to his co-workers about their union rights, he says his weekly hours were cut from 40 to 18. He then faced eviction and homelessness- which he avoided only thanks to the mercy of his landlord and by quitting Wal-Mart in order to cash in his 401(k).

These are the realities of Wal-Mart's attitude toward unions. But even unionbusting companies sometimes allow workers to form unions once it becomes economically painful not to. The question is: Will American unions ever be able to bring enough pain to Wal-Mart? tap

It is easy to promise "competitive" wages in neighborhoods with more than 20 percent unemployment. There isn't any "competition."

[...] the battles have revealed WalMart's weaknesses, too. Since most development in New York is, to say the least, not constrained by any democratic processes, Wal-Mart, in 2005, didn't feel it had to make a case to New Yorkers.

Wal-Mart's new green-washed image is deflecting attention from the drag the company continues to inflict on workers' wages and communities' quality of life.

When you get off Highway 101 at Exit 484A, you immediately fall into headachy traffic on access roads not designed for this crush. It is the kind of dysfunction that Wal-Mart would never tolerate in its own internal operations but that big-box stores breed in the world they increasingly define. This Wal-Mart is in Rohnert Park, California, about 50 miles north of San Francisco.

I'd been hearing about Wal-Mart's efforts to mend its ways, offering energy efficiency, zero waste, organic cotton, and even organic food. It all seemed so unlikely- a little like walking into Fox News' offices and finding a wing devoted to The American Prospect- that I wanted to see for myself. (My son, who is 8, was more interested in the Wal-Martexclusive Nerf gun.)

Not much has changed since our last visit several years ago, visibly at least. There are some T-shirts made with organic cotton; I buy one to send a market message. The display of compact fluorescent bulbs is impressive. Beyond that, the new offerings aren't the dramatic shift the pub - licity suggests. But most of Wal-Mart's new efficiencies, such as fuel savings in the truck fleet and recycling of store scrap, are not obvious to shoppers yet, anyway.

There is little doubt, moreover, that more environmentally friendly product changes are coming. All of which creates dissonance of the first order and a conundrum for those who care about the human prospect. Localism, at a company that enshrined the "China price"- the price that other suppliers have to match- and at which instructions regarding shelf placement come down from the corporate headquarters in Bentonville? Conservation, at the global giant whose very being is premised upon hyper-consumption, sprawl, and waste? (My son, whose friends buy toys here, says Wal-Mart's motto should be "Costs less, breaks sooner.*)

Kierkegaard urged us to cultivate a healthy sense of paradox, but this truly is a stretch. We think about Stonyfield Farm yogurt in Wal-Mart's refrigerator cases and Seventh Generation detergent on the shelves. Then we think about the traffic and the employees whose kids are on public assistance (over 40 percent in some states) because the company pays so little. We also think about the local merchants this chain and others have displaced and the sheer power of this behemoth to bend the world to its will.

But what if that bend were in the direction of ecological efficiency? Would the power still be so bad? Gary Hirshberg, the CEO of Stonyfield Farm recalls a gathering of manufacturers in China. When the Wal-Mart representative spoke, Hirshberg says, it was as if they were hearing their master s voice: "You could have heard a pin drop." The U.S. president doesn't get that kind of respect.

There is a camel's nose and a tent here, but it is not clear which is which. Most remarkable, though, is that we are talking about Wal-Mart and compact fluorescents to begin with. Not that long ago, the focus would have been the company's Third World-style labor practices and superstores that put local merchants out of business. Wal-Mart's embrace of ecology, sincere as it may be, was not uncontrived. Rather, it has been part of alarger public-relations effort to upstage those troublesome questions.

The effort has substantially succeeded. By Wal-Mart's own reckonings, in 2006, it ranked in the sub-basement among retail outlets in "global reputation." Today, it is near the top, and some of the nation's major environmental groups are standing at its side. This gives the conundrum yet another twist. Is the complicity of the Environmental Defense Fund and others the latest evidence of the failure of the environmental movement to conceive of an ecology in which people truly matter - ordinary workers in particular? Or is it a necessary "bargain with the devil," as one green activist put it, that will hasten environmental breakthroughs, problems and all?

ROHNERT PARK IS PART of the Santa Rosa sprawl and a last outpost of affordable housing in what is called the North Bay. Many service workers from neighboring Marin County live up here. Not coincidentally, this Wal-Mart is the last until the other side of San Francisco.

In between is prime retail territory, but for most of Wal-Mart's history, that fact didn't much matter. The hinterlands offered plenty of room as well as accommodating county councils and workforces that knew their place. By the early 200Os, however, that game was over. New Wal-Mart stores were cannibalizing existing ones, and the only path of domestic growth lay in the cities. That meant zoning and permit battles, messy racial and ethnic politics, and also environmental sensibilities the company used to be able to ignore.

Wal-Mart's record wasn't going to help. Recent lawsuits had made it a synonym for abuse of workers. (The case charging blatant discrimination against women was filed in San Francisco in 2001. The company epitomized sprawl and waste and the flight of factory jobs to China. The consulting firm McKinsey & Company had found in 2005 that somewhere between 2 percent and 8 percent of Wal-Mart customers had stopped shopping there for such reasons. Smaller rivals such as Costco and Target were prospering on these troubles.

Wal-Mart went to Edelman, a tony global flack house that specializes in what it calls "reputation management." (Previous clients included tobacco companies and the American Petroleum Institute.) It was not long before the Astroturf appeared, in the form of a group called Working Families for Wal-Mart. The group supposedly sent a couple- "Jim and Laura"- on the road to talk with Wal-Mart employees and blog about the conversations, which were unfailingly positive.

It came out later that Wal-Mart itself hadpaidforthe excursion and that "Laura" was the sister of an Edelman employee who was working at Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville. Richard Edelman, the company chair, clarified the situation thus: "I do believe that it is a real group of real people, as far as I know."

Other gambits were more successful. Then-CEO Lee Scott appeared at a press conference in 2007 with Andy Stern ofthe Service Employees International Union to support universal medical insurance. The company also supported the extension ofthe Voting Rights Act. (This didn't stop it from lavishing campaign cash upon Republicans who opposed both.) Edelman enlisted right-wing bloggers to spin the company's post-Hurricane Katrina good deeds: Corporations work and government doesn't.

Wal-Mart enabled customers to buy some 300 generic drugs for $4 aprescription. Recently, the company- or more precisely, Edelman- scored a coup when it got Michelle Obamato announce ajoint healthful food initiative. It did not escape notice that the partnership came just as Wal-Mart was gearing up for battle over its expansion plans in New York City, nor that one part of the healthful eating program was building Wal-Mart stores in inner-city "food deserts"- communities lacking quality grocery stores.

AS IT PURSUES ITS reputational management, Wal-Mart has not just its own considerable resources but also those of the company foundation, which shares the corporate website. The foundation has invested strategically in such groups as the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, the National Council of La Raza, the Congressional Black Caucus, the NAACP, and National Public Radio, all of which have received half a million dollars or more. (The WalMart Foundation also gave $10,000 to the 10th anniversary gala of Demos, with which the Prospect is affiliated.)

The foundation also has attended to the small-town base. An example is Wal-Mart Teacher Rewards, through which 10 teachers in selected schoolssome 40,000 teachers in all- get $100 each for classroom supplies. The credits are good only at Wal-Mart and Sam's Club. Typically, local papers run glowing accounts, with pictures ofhappy teachers. The effort would be more impressive, though, if Wal-Mart didn't routinely challenge its property-tax assessments in localities like these.

A 2007 study by Good Jobs First found that each year, the company makes formal appeals on more than a third of its stores and on 40 percent of its distribution centers. These have resulted in tax reductions that averaged $40,000 and $289,000, respectively. A county assessor in Arkansas named Dan Hurst Jr. who resisted these efforts told The New York Times that starting in 2003 WalMart sent a trio of lawyers and a couple of accountants to beat him down, to no avail, as it turned out.

Hurst said he knew Sam Walton, the late company founder, personally. "I'm sure he would not approve," Hurst said, of these attempts to take back money "that goes for our kids' schools."

The local stories generally did not mention such tempering considerations. More important, by 2009, the high-level narrative was changing, too, from fallen giant to corporate rebirth. The fulcrum of this shift had a tantalizing unlikeliness. "The company that democratized consumption," The New York Times enthused in January 2009, with historical liberties, "has begun to democratize environmental sustainability as well."

THE START OF WAL-MART'S environmental push in 2005 did not suggest deep commitment. Activist groups were targeting the company. Management wanted to forestall more bad publicity. The Edelman executive on the Wal-Mart account was Leslie Dach, who had worked at the Audubon Society and then the Environmental Defense Fund before he went into Democratic politics- serving Edward Kennedy's staff in 1980 and then Michael Dukakis' in 1988- and later corporate public relations. Dach has since joined Wal-Mart full time, where, among other promotional duties, he oversees the foundation.

Dach's environmental concerns may be genuine. But one of his pet strategies is to "co-opt your would-be attackers." In late 2004, Wal-Mart's top management duly hosted a group ofthe company's critics in Bentonville, and then-CEO Scott promised to explore their recommendations. As his managers dug in, they discovered an unexpected affinity. When you stripped away the eco-talk, this really was about cutting waste and getting the maximum value from every ounce of resources.

This was Wal-Mart's wheelhouse, practically its self-definition. The company had been squeezing workers from the beginning. Now, it could demand more productivity from energy and materials as well. It could bully the supply chain as before, only in a different way- and one that made environmental groups euphoric. A number ofthe major organizations- the Rocky Mountain Institute, the World Wildlife Federation, the Environmental Defense Fund, and others- signed on as advisers.

There was a rich irony. For years, such groups had sought to tilt the economy toward environmental ends through arcane pricing schemes- energy taxes, carbon trading, and the like. They had lectured on the evils of the old, regulatory "command and control" approach, as opposed to this elegant new "market based" model. Now, they were at the epicenter of the corporate market, at the ear of its retail monarch, and it turned out to be another version of command and control.

What Wal-Mart wanted it got, and because the retailer dealt with almost 60,000 suppliers, its potential impact was hard to overstate. "Being able to say to farmers in the Central Valley, If you do this, we will buy your stuff'- that's how you change the world," says Hirshberg of Stonyfi eld Farm.

An early example of green efficiency was Wal-Mart's decision to carry only extraconcentrated laundry detergents. From a business standpoint, the smaller packages meant more units per shipping palette and thus, lower transportation costs. From an ecological standpoint, the reduction in water use alone would equal about 100 million showers ayear. "Lee [Scott] pushed me," says A.G. Lafley, former-CEO of Proctor and Gamble, "and we totally, totally changed the way we manufacture liquid detergents, and now around the world."

If Proctor and Gamble could be brought to heel, anything was possible. Efficient LED lights in parking lots and in freezers, where they would emit less heat. Packaging for vegetables made of plant-based plastic. Pet beds and litter pans made from old plastic hangers and bottles. Rebecca Calahan Klein, who, as head of the Organic Exchange, helped guide Wal-Mart into organic cotton (and who was not paid by Wal-Mart), observes that, unlike many other companies, WalMart embraced this work for real. Managers were evaluated in part on their ability to wring productivity from energy and materials. "The commitment came from the top," Klein says.

CRITICS EXPRESS A WARY and sometimes grudging respect for Wal-Mart's environmental efforts. Former CEO Scott "got religion," says Michael Marx, executive director of Corporate Ethics International, who helped organize the campaign that Scott was trying to deflect. He adds a caveat, though. Wal-Mart "was willing to do the things that clearly made money." The problems lie outside that self-defined realm.

For one, the vaunted ability to drive the supply chain has a double edge, especially where workers are concerned. When Wal-Mart added groceries in Southern California, the existing stores there, such as Albertsons and Safeway, had to demand major concessions. WalMart drives the market not just for products but for wages as well.

It also drives toward a scale that corresponds to its own. Stonyfield Farm may have to buy powdered organic milk from New Zealand to meet the demand from Wal-Mart as well as from Whole Foods. Wal-Mart "pushes us to factory farms," Marx says. "The humane, organic factory farm does not exist."

Wal-Mart's deliberate co-opting of major environmental groups, moreover, has diminished an important counterweight. Someone needs to verify claims and point to problems not addressed. The big environmental groups should maintain a capacity for "arm's length critical analysis," says Stacy Mitchell, senior researcher of the Institute for Local SelfReliance and author of Big Box Swindle. Instead, they have become "so much in Wal-Mart's pocket." When I contacted the Rocky Mountain Institute, founded by Amory Lovins, a spokesperson said there would be no comment on Wal-Mart because of a "client relationship."

Much lies outside the company's own ecological cost cutting: the parking lot and traffic, the sprawl and waste, the fate of the employees and the social ecology generally. One estimate found that Wal-Mart's own growth could cancel out the efficiencies that it achieves. In fairness, Wal-Mart is not alone in all this. I asked Marx whether Target is really any better. "Not at all," he replied. Target's progress has been largely in Wal-Mart's "slip stream."

Conscientious environmentalists are wrestling with these tensions. Jeffrey Hollender, the founder and former CEO of Seventh Generation, the householdproducts company, agonized before he finally agreed to sell in selected WalMart stores. When I asked how he justified it, his response was much like that of Rebecca Calahan Klein and others with whom I spoke. A pause, a sigh, and then reflections on the theme of doing what you can with the world as it is.

"The business model of Wal-Mart was not designed by Wal-Mart," Hollender said. "It was adapted by them as it has been by most American corporations." Wal-Mart simply does a better job of playing the game (and, of course, using its weight to keep the rules the way it likes them), he added. "We need to put as much energy into understanding the disastrous design of the economic systern as we do in challenging individual practitioners ofthat system."

Green Monster: This Texas branch gets 8 percent of its energy from wind and solar power. Unfortunately, it isn't clear that Wal-Mart's growth won't cancel out its new efficiencies.

Localism, at a company that enshrined the "China price"- the price that other suppliers have to match- and at which instructions regarding shelf placement come down from the corporate headquarters in Bentonville? Conservation, at the global giant whose very being is premised upon hyper-consumption, sprawl, and waste? (My son, whose friends buy toys here, says Wal-Mart's motto should be Costs less, breaks sooner.*) Kierkegaard urged us to cultivate a healthy sense of paradox, but this truly is a stretch. The big environmental groups should maintain a capacity for "arm's length critical analysis," says Stacy Mitchell, senior researcher of the Institute for Local SelfReliance and author of Big Box Swindle.

Losing sleep: a looming    discrimination  suit is keeping Walmart executives up at night. But the real concern is not whether the retailer will survive, but how it will adapt.(SOUNDING BOARD)

For me, the fun part about being a journalist is not just looking for answers, but asking questions. One of my longtime favorite queries for executives I interview is: "What keeps you up at night?"

My personal a.m. epiphanies are pretty simple, like whether I let the dog out, how I'm going to get through a three-deadline day or if I took the pot roast out of the freezer.

I suspect the issues causing insomnia among Walmart executives are a bit more complex as they ponder "what if ...?" As in "what if" they have to pony up billions of dollars in a gender discrimination class action lawsuit. If that is not enough to keep you up nights, I don't know what is.

My second question is somewhat less contentious, but just as important: "What is next?' This isn't about whether the house that Walmart built will survive but how-it will adapt. It has reached a seminal period in its development and the strategies that made it king of the hill may not work as well in a vastly different and rapidly changing retail environment in which smaller formats, urban retailing, uber discounting (e.g., Aldi) and customization are crucial.

One tactical shift was the chain's recent announcement that it is setting up Walmart East in Atlanta. Walmart East will be responsible for the strategic direction, including supply chain, personnel and real estate decisions, of 1,600 stores.

Pardon the military metaphor, but this is all about putting boots on the ground where you need them. In this case, penetration of urban markets such as New York with a more flexible strategy, according to Natalie Berg, global research director for Planet Retail in London. Does logic dictate that the next step might be Walmart West to exploit opportunities in uncharted territories like California? Maybe even Walmart Midwest to explore the Plains states, or to take a more focused approach to Chicago, which is looking more and more like ground zero for Walmart Express.

This might be a bit over the top and opinions are mixed about how deeply Walmart could or wants to divisionalize. But this brings us to the question of whether we might see a new "decentralized" Walmart under which decision-making is no longer just a broadcast from Bentonville.

This would necessitate a long-term shift in its basic business philosophy that is unlikely to happen if, in any way, it adds to the cost of doing business. That is the deal breaker.

However, pushing decision-making into the field is not altogether unknown. It is why Walmart succeeded in quickly getting food, water and other supplies to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina when FEMA was paralyzed by a centralized bureaueracy. It was Walmart at its best--exploiting core competencies without tripping over itself.

Local ingenuity is also why the chain was able lo quickly reopen stores and stock shelves in the wake of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that rocked Japan, a situation that could easily have been a supply chain nightmare. It is also win certain synergies learned in Latin America will be exported to China and to small box retailing in the U.S, according to Berg, citing such retail formats as Bodega Aurrera Express in Mexico or Todo Dia in Brazil. Both have ROIs equivalent to supercenters, but are small enough for tier two and tier three cities.

Decentralization, if you will allow me to use a broad definition, could also take place if Walmart acquired or partnered with other retail channels like health food stores instead of developing them in-house. They could very well bow to local expertise in order to avoid what some call a "knowledge problem."

Quite simply, people and operations need room to adapt. !n this respect, Walmart is no different than die rest of the industry. They have done it overseas, so why not here?

This kind of regional or local control, combined with the shopper analytics that Walmart corporate is honing through its consumer Insights division, will make them an even more formidable.

That thought will be keeping a lot of people up at night.

GENERAL RETAILERS

Walmart's chief executive Mike Duke was targeted by protesters as he gave his strongest signal yet of the company's renewed desire to open stores in New York, in spite of stiff political opposition.

Mr Duke, head of the world's largest retailer by sales, said: "We know there are millions of customers here in this great city that don't have easy access to a Walmart store. We would like to help solve that problem."

But within minutes of his comments at a New York breakfast on Wednesday, the venue was besieged by demonstrators.

They accused the retailer of mistreating its workers and endangering small businesses, chanting: "Walmart cheats, Walmart hates, Walmartdiscriminates."

Walmart rejects such charges, but the pre-planned demonstration underscored the political challenges in the way of the retailer's strategy.

Walmart is seeking to revive the growth performance of its US business by moving beyond "big box" stores to open smaller outlets in large cities. New York, America's biggest urban retail market, stands out as the final frontier.

The retailer has saturated suburban and rural areas with its low-price Supercenter stores, but stores open at least a year have produced seven consecutive quarters of declining sales.

"We are very, very interested in New York," Mr Duke said at an event organised by the Wall Street Journal. But he added: "There are lots of steps in the process here."

Pointing to pent-up demand for Walmart among the city's consumers, he said the company's analysis of credit card transactions showed that last year New Yorkers had spent $195m at Walmart stores they drove to outside the city.

Four years ago Mr Duke's predecessor expressed exasperation over the cost and difficulty of his attempts to enter New York and said: "I don't care if we are ever here." Walmart has warmed to the city more recently and launched a campaign of lobbying and advertising to promote the benefits of its low prices, job creation and sales tax payments.

NEW YORK — Protesters, some carrying union placards, many hoisting "mean smiley face" signs, tried to drown out a presentation here today by Mike Duke, president and chief executive officer, Wal-Mart Stores .

Duke was about 25 minutes into his presentation about the company, the economy and other issues when a crowd assembled outside the windowed enclosure of the Bryant Park Grill and began chanting, "Wal-Mart cheats, Wal-Mart hates, Wal-Martdiscriminates."

The crowd grew to an estimated few score protesters, who were joined by a few drummers and trumpet-players. Duke ignored the commotion, and the crowd dispersed after about half an hour. The "Viewpoints Executive Breakfast" meeting was hosted by the Wall Street Journal.

In his presentation, Duke said he believes Wal-Mart's core customer is under even more pressure than a year ago, as evidenced by spending trends in the stores, and exacerbated by rising gas prices.

"When they pay more money for gas, they have less money for discretionary spending," he said. "That's the way the math works."

He also said that as technology becomes more widely available to consumers, they are making more informed pricing decisions.

"Customers are communicating with each other, and sharing information about where they spend money and what they buy, and that's a dynamic area that's changed in the last few years," he said.

U.S.    discrimination  case may not go all Wal-Mart's way; Retail giant argues group of plaintiffs is too big

Oral arguments had barely finished in the Wal-Mart sexdiscrimination case at the U.S. Supreme Court when many commentators declared total victory for the retail behemoth.

But interviews with legal scholars and civil-litigation experts suggest that the rush to judgment may have been premature, with at least a partial victory for the plaintiffs not out of the question.

The case, Dukes v. Wal-Mart Inc., centres on whether a group of up to 1.5 million current and former Wal-Mart workers was properly certified as a class by U.S. District Court in San Francisco, a decision that created the biggest such class in U.S. history and that was upheld by the Ninth Circuit in 2007.

Wal-Mart wants the Supreme Court to decertify the class, arguing that Wal-Mart workers in different jobs in 3,800 stores with different managers could not have faced the same pattern of discrimination in pay and promotion decisions, and therefore should not be considered one class. Written broadly, a ruling dismissing the suit could effectively overhaul class certification standards, dimming the prospects for class-action lawsuits of all kinds.

But many experts are expecting a more nuanced result.

"Even if they're so inclined, it will be hard (for the court) to find a way to completely dispose of the suit at this point," said Michael Selmi, a professor of civil rights and employment law at George Washington University Law School in Washington, D.C. "It would be too inconsistent with previous case law. Other options are on the table."

In one potential outcome, the justices could uphold the district court's decision that the plaintiffs potentially have enough in common to qualify as a class, but send it back to the district court to determine which specific rules of civil procedure apply.

In this scenario, the court would provide guidance on whether a more stringent certification standard is appropriate. The plaintiffs would then have to begin anew the process of establishing class certification under these requirements, and the lower court could split the class into smaller components.

Such an outcome would be a blow to the plaintiffs, but it would not undermine this or future sex-discrimination lawsuits in a way that throwing out the case would, said Arthur Miller, professor of civil procedure at New York University School of Law.

"Remanding the case might enable a district judge to take this monstrous class and subdivide it along rational lines, such as location, job description, or alleged type of discrimination," Miller said. "That way, you wouldn't have what some might call a woolly mammoth."

During the March 29 oral argument, justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer hinted at another possible ruling: The court could uphold certification of the class and allow for possible injunctive relief, but not back pay or punitive damages. In this scenario, the case would return to the district court, where plaintiffs would argue that Wal-Mart must clarify how it makes pay and promotion decisions and ensure that managers are held accountable for their decisions. Plaintiffs would have to pursue monetary claims separately. Such a ruling would make it more difficult, but not impossible, to recover back pay in class-action suits.

To be sure, Justice Anthony Kennedy, often the deciding vote when the court splits on ideological lines, expressed deep skepticism about the plaintiffs' case.

"Your complaint faces in two directions ... it seems to me there's an inconsistency there, and I'm just not sure what the unlawful policy is," Kennedy told Joseph Sellers, a partner at Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, who argued for the plaintiffs.

Kennedy's questioning -along with acerbic comments by Justice Antonin Scalia -led many observers to declare that the plaintiffs' case could be doomed.

"My sense from the oral arguments is that Kennedy and others may be preparing to deliver an opinion that will have implications beyond plaintiffs in the Dukes case," said Katherine Kimpel, a partner at Sanford Wittels & Heisler who served as lead counsel for the plaintiffs in the Velez v. Novartis sex-discrimination case, which resulted in the largest-ever U.S. employment discrimination verdict.

Kennedy may have tipped his hand, but the justices may not all end up voting as expected, said Alexandra Lahav, a civil-procedure expert and law professor at the University of Connecticut.

Clarence Thomas, is a "wild card," Lahav argued, pointing to a 2002 ruling in another employment-discrimination case, Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, in which Thomas upheld the plaintiff's complaint and articulated a fairly low bar for bringing employment- discrimination lawsuits.

A statistical analysis of sex-discrimination cases before the high court also suggests that plaintiffs tend to fare well, though defendants in recent years have won several high-profile cases. Not including disability cases, plaintiffs prevailed in approximately 70 per cent of all employment-based discrimination cases in the last two decades, according to research conducted by George Washington University's Selmi. The Wal-Mart case is also the first major sex-discrimination case before a Supreme Court that includes three women.

Theodore Boutros, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who made the oral argument for the defence, did not return an e-mail requesting comment on the case. Greg Rossiter, a spokesman for Wal-Mart, said the company declined to comment.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs, for their part, said they are prepared for a mixed result.

"There is likely to be a nuanced resolution to this case," Sellers said in an interview. "The Court has a lot of options; it could go with us in one way and against us in another."

Wal-Mart CEO: Consumers feeling greater pressure

NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — Consumers’ spending power has been affected In the face of rising fuel prices and other inflationary pressures, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s Chief Executive Mike Duke said on Wednesday.

The world’s largest retailer (WMT, US) , which gets 140 million customers in its U.S. Walmart stores alone every week, has seen more shoppers spending more on the first day of the month when they receive their paychecks, Duke said at The Wall Street Journal Viewpoints executive breakfast presentation in New York.

“Our customers are running out of money, buying smaller pack sizes and less discretionary items near the end of the month,” Duke said. “It shows greater pressure on consumers. Rising fuel price has been one of the factors that affect consumer spending. The end of paycheck cycle is pronounced among our core customers.”

Consumers, still facing a near 9% unemployment rate, also is bracing for other inflationary cost pressures in areas such as fresh foods even as categories such as consumer electronics continue to see price declines, Duke said.

“Inflation and fuel price have come into place” along with other economic pressures to hurt consumer spending, he said.

With the rising fuel pressures, Duke said one-stop shopping has “become even more important.” Consumers also have become more focused on “value and price” and use technology such as smart phones to compare prices while in stores, he said.

“Consumers have learned to pay attention to what they pay,” he said. “It’s a form of (behavior) reset. Price transparency is becoming even more important.”

Rousing protesters in NY battle

The fuel and cost pressures are coming at a time when Walmart U.S. is seeking to reverse seven straight quarters of declining same-store sales. Duke reiterated the company is focused on everyday low prices and a wide assortment as one-stop shopping becomes even more important.

“I like the traction and direction we are in,” he said.

Duke said at a Barclays Capital conference presentation on Tuesday that Walmart plans to “hold down on price increases” as it works with its suppliers to cut costs in other areas. He said Wednesday that with the company’s focus on everyday low prices, he doesn’t see a need to introduce program like the one its smaller rival Target Corp. (TGT, US) has in giving a 5% discount on purchases made with its store cards.

Walmart U.S., about two-thirds of the $400 billion-plus Wal-Mart’s total, is changing its course after an earlier decision to narrow product assortment and another strategy to lower prices on select products in so-called rollbacks didn’t fare as well as expected and alienated some shoppers. The company recently unveiled a campaign promising price-match guarantee and everyday low prices.

“We got away from some of our core principals,” Duke said, disputing the notion that Walmart U.S. sales have reached their peak.

The company is also focused on expanding online sales and tapping tools such as social networks, he said. Walmart recently began a test in a San Jose, Calif., store of home delivery of online grocery orders and has agreed to buy Kosmix, a social media start-up.

Part of Duke’s strategy to spur growth in the U.S. also includes exploring expanding in urban markets including New York.

“We are very interested in New York,” he said, adding New Yorkers last year spent $195 million outside of the city at its stores. “You think about the sales and tax and jobs and what that means for the city.”

Walmart’s attempt to enter New York, however, won’t go unchallenged. Outside of the breakfast presentation at the Bryant Park Grill, about 100 protesters gathered, including those from the local chapter of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. They brought in a brass band outside of the glass-windowed restaurant and had someone in a character as “Mr. Walmart” on stilts fighting another person dressed as the Statute of Liberty.

Outside of the U.S. Duke said China may be “the biggest opportunity.” He also said the rising wage inflation in that country will end up affecting product costs though he doesn’t expect the industry will see a “dramatic shift” away from manufacturing in the country.

In response to the company facing possibly the biggest civil-rights class action lawsuit against a private employer in U.S. history, Duke said individual situations don’t represent thousands of its workers. The suit was filed by current and former female employees who allege discrimination while working there.

In March, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments to help it decide whether the lawsuit can proceed as a class action. See the March story.

New York demonstrators target Walmart chief

Mike Duke, Walmart's chief executive, was targeted by protesters as he gave his strongest signal yet of the company's renewed desire to open stores in New York, in spite of stiff political opposition.

Mr Duke, head of the world's largest retailer by sales, said: "We know there are millions of customers here in this great city that don't have easy access to a Walmart store. We would like to help solve that problem."

But within minutes of his comments at a New York breakfast on Wednesday, the venue was besieged by demonstrators.

They accused the retailer of mistreating its workers and endangering small businesses, chanting: "Walmart cheats, Walmart hates, Walmartdiscriminates."

Walmart rejects such charges, but the pre-planned demonstration underscored the political challenges in the way of the retailer's strategy.

Walmart is seeking to revive the growth performance of its US business by moving beyond "big box" stores to open smaller outlets in large cities. New York, America's biggest urban retail market, stands out as the final frontier.

The retailer has saturated suburban and rural areas with its low-price Supercenter stores, but stores open at least a year have produced seven consecutive quarters of declining sales.

"We are very, very interested in New York," Mr Duke said at an event organised by the Wall Street Journal. But he added: "There are lots of steps in the process here."

Pointing to pent-up demand for Walmart among the city's consumers, he said the company's analysis of credit card transactions showed that last year, New Yorkers had spent $195m at Walmart stores outside the city.

Four years ago, Mr Duke's predecessor expressed exasperation over the cost and difficulty of entering New York and said: "I don't care if we are ever here." Walmart has warmed to the city more recently and launched a campaign of lobbying and advertising to promote the benefits of its low prices, job creation and sales tax payments.

But it continues to face fierce opposition led by unions and politicians. As Mr Duke spoke, protesters outside the window behind him tried to drown him out with trumpets, drums and a chorus of "Mr Walmart - who do you think you are?".

Maritza Silva-Farrell, an activist who helped organise the demonstration, said: "Walmart does not have the values of New Yorkers … We want to send a message loud and clear that they don't belong and we will do everything we can to stop them."

Ms Silva-Farrell works for Walmart Free NYC, a group that represents some New York workers, residents and small business owners.

She said Walmart was not an "inclusive" employer and claimed that in New York it would kill off small retailers and refuse to build ties with local companies outside its own finely tuned logistics systems.

Court rules for company in dispute over taxes on 'free' cell phone

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A divided Supreme Court gave a big victory Wednesday to business interests, ruling that a cell phone carrier's arbitration clause in contracts that ban larger class-action lawsuits is permissible.

The 5-4 ruling along ideological lines stopped a claim over whether an AT&T cell phone was falsely advertised as "free." The plaintiffs wanted to bring others into a larger putative class action.

At issue was whether federal law has sway over-- or "pre-empts"-- state contract laws. Several states have tossed out many class-action barriers by businesses as "unconscionable" and therefore unenforceable.

Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia said class arbitration cannot be forced on parties when their contract explicitly prohibits it.

"The California law in question stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the purposes and objectives" of federal arbitration standards, he said.

The financial stakes are huge and both sides of the case had lined up an impressive list of allies. Competing arguments were made about whether the high court ruling would end either arbitration or class action, as both currently exist.

Consumer protection groups say this ruling against them will make it easier for companies to use the fine print in business and employment contracts to get away with widespread fraud to consumers and discrimination of its own workers.

But business groups worry a flood of frivolous lawsuits would ensue if consumers can file large class-action lawsuits -- involving perhaps thousands of plaintiffs -- that industries say would be costly to the economy and to competition.

The justices are currently deciding a separate case involving what would become the largest class-action in U.S. history, a workplace discrimination claim by female employees of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's biggest retailer. A ruling in that case is expected within two months.

The case announced Wednesday involves Vincent and Liza Concepcion, who signed a purchase agreement eight years ago for cellular phone service in California. AT&T Mobility advertised a "free" Nokia phone with the purchase of a $150 Motorola phone. The company then charged sales tax on both devices, totaling about $30. The Concepcions objected, but because of the small amount at stake, they did not want to sue by themselves. They decided to press the claim on behalf of other phone purchasers as well.

The service agreement the couple signed included the phrase, in capital letters: "You and AT&T agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding."

After the lawsuit was filed, AT&T revised its arbitration provisions in a way that a federal court concluded greatly benefited the consumer. But federal courts also agreed the Concepcion class-action lawsuit could proceed, citing California law that said some contracts can be considered unenforceable if they are built on deception, are too one-sided, or violate broader public policy.

The company then appealed, citing the Federal Arbitration Act, an 85-year-old congressional law permitting class-action exemptions to stand when combined with arbitration. Wednesday's high court ruling now gives AT&T the power now to have the phone dispute handled by a private arbiter, who would only weigh the specific competing claims and render a binding ruling.

Scalia noted that arbitration is a generally faster and cheaper alternative to a civil trial that could drag on for years, including appeals. Adding class-action status often only adds to the time and money expended. Jury verdicts can also in some cases lead to massive judgments against firms convicted of corporate wrongdoing.

"The aggregation of claims in class arbitration greatly increases the stakes for the defendant," said Scalia. "And when stakes are very high, the informality of arbitration becomes much less appealing, because there is little opportunity for judicial review to correct the mistakes that informality produces." He was supported by Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito.

In dissent, Stephen Breyer warned requiring consumers to arbitrate disputes on an individual basis could lead them to walk away rather than litigate, if the typical monetary stakes are relatively small.

"What rational lawyer would have signed on to represent the Concepcions in litigation for the possibility of fees stemming from a $30.22 claim?" said Breyer. "Why is this kind of decision-- weighing the pros and cons of all class proceedings alike-- not California's to make?" Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan joined Breyer.

The Concepcions were supported by two dozen consumer, civil rights, and worker rights groups, many of whom expressed initial disappointment to the ruling.

"Today's majority opinion is judicial policy-making in its most naked form," said Doug Kendall of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center, which filed a legal brief supporting the plaintiffs. "The Federal Arbitration Act is in no way hostile to class actions, and it specifically preserves a critical role for state law."

But a variety of business interests urged the high court to uphold its precedent in related cases. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce's litigation arm had filed an amicus brief that said "class arbitration does not deter misconduct, but rather forces parties into costly litigation."

The high court in two separate appeals last spring gave victories to big business over enforceability of arbitration requirements in contracts.

The current case is AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion (09-893).

Labor has Target in its sights; With one eye on Walmart, workers campaign to organize No. 2 big-box retailer

The target is now Target.

Though even the prospect of Walmart laying stake to ground in the city has elicited howls from organized labor and its allies in government, fellow big-box retailer Target has managed to establish a firm foothold in the city without so much as a peep of opposition.

Late last week, however, the 23,000-member United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1500 filed for a union election at a Target store in Valley Stream, L.I., a stone’s throw from Queens. It was the opening salvo in what Local 1500 officials say will be an aggressive, extended campaign to organize workers at 27 Target stores in the New York area, including its 10 stores in the five boroughs. Union staff, who have been meeting with Target employees for two months, say the recent attention on Walmart’s labor practices prompted the workers to come forward to organize for higher wages and better hours.

“They looked at it and said, ‘Maybe my company doesn’t have a 1.5 million-women sex discrimination lawsuit, but, hey, we have issues too,’ “ said Pat Purcell, assistant to the president of Local 1500, referring to a class action against Walmart. “Whatever free ride Target has gotten to this point is over.”

Mr. Purcell added that wages and distribution of hours are the main complaints, with workers reporting 8-cent raises and workweeks of as few as five hours.

“We have pride in our company, but we just don’t feel they have pride in us,” said Sonia Williams, of Jamaica, Queens, an overnight clerk at the Valley Stream store, in a statement provided by the union. “We believe the time for change has come for Target.”

Low-key

A spokeswoman for the company declined an interview request but issued a statement to Crain’s. “Target’s emphasis is on creating an environment of mutual trust between Target and our team members—an environment that promotes listening, responding to concerns of team members and always giving honest feedback,” the statement said. “We want to continue to create the kind of workplace where team members don’t want or need union representation to resolve issues.”

Target has three stores in Brooklyn, three in Queens, two in the Bronx, one in Manhattan and one on Staten Island. None of its 1,755 stores nationwide are unionized.

In addition to responding to employee complaints, Local 1500 has an urgent need to organize the estimated 7,000 workers at area Target stores. In the past year, the retailer has pushed to increase its food operations, a move that could erode the market share of unionized grocers such as ShopRite, Waldbaum’s and Pathmark. Target sent glossy brochures promoting its expanded grocery sections to city residents and offered shoppers free bread and eggs. Higher food sales are a reason the retailer expects to increase annual revenues from $66 billion to more than $100 billion as early as 2016.

“We have to organize Target stores, or we’ll soon be irrelevant,” said Bernie Hesse, political director of UFCW Local 1189 in Minnesota, Target’s home state. The union recently decided to renew a campaign against Target that fizzled several years ago in the face of opposition from the company, Mr. Hesse said.

A campaign against Target also neutralizes Walmart’s argument that it is being unfairly singled out as a nonunion mass-market retailer. Walmart declined to comment.

“There’s a tremendous opportunity to organize Target workers because of their low wages and limited hours,” said Burt Flickinger, managing partner of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group.

The union faces challenges on several fronts. Locals around the country have made only tepid efforts to engage Target workers, as their focus has been on Walmart. Additionally, retail workers are notoriously difficult to organize, both because of high turnover and employers’ vigorous counterefforts.

And Mr. Purcell said Target workers have told organizers that they were shown an extended video that told them to “think hard before you sign any card or petition.” The video, standard fare for shops looking to keep out unions, referred to dues, telling the workers that “no team member has ever had to pay one nickel of their paycheck to a union to get fair treatment from Target.”

The company has thus far avoided the scrutiny that its much-larger competitor has come under, even though analysts say the two pay about the same wages. Target has built a squeaky-clean public image, partly by donating millions to local charities and sponsoring cultural events—and partly by not being Walmart.

The domino effect

Target’s response to the union campaign—regardless of who wins—will have several repercussions in labor’s bigger battle: Walmart. If Target’s pushback is moderate, Walmart could feel pressure to soften its stance. If, however, Target gets tough with workers, it could find itself in Walmart’s boat, with once-friendly politicians teaming up with labor to stop more stores from opening.

“If they do a slash-and-burn campaign, they lower their profile in terms of respectability,” said Ed Ott, a labor lecturer at the City University of New York’s Murphy Institute. “It’s a test of whether Target is fundamentally any different than Walmart.”

"Giving the accused a firm presumption of innocence is not unreasonable, much less 'deliberately indifferent' to harassment, and thus is not illegal."

To the Editor:

The Education Department's April 4 guidance falsely claimed that federal law already requires colleges to discipline people accused of sexual harassment even if there is only a 51-percent chance they are guilty, rather than more convincing evidence ("Education Dept. Issues New Guidance for Sexual-Assault Investigations," The Chronicle, April 4). That is not the case.

Court rulings like Adler v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (1998) and Knabe v. Boury Corp. (1997) have held that institutions are not automatically required to discipline an accused har-asser when it was genuinely unclear if he was guilty. Under the Supreme Court's 1999 decision in Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, a complainant must show not only that harassment has occurred, but also that the school was "deliberately indifferent" to the harassment. Giving the accused a firm presumption of innocence is not unreasonable, much less "deliberately indifferent" to harassment, and thus is not illegal. That is true even under the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard for school liabil-ity that applies in civil cases and civil-rights proceedings.

Pittsburg woman back at work after star turn at U.S. Supreme Court

April 22--PITTSBURG -- Betty Dukes was back greeting customers this week at the Walmart here, a long way in distance and circumstance from the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard her gender-discrimination case against the retail giant last month.

The high court is considering whether to allow Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. -- the largest sex-discrimination suit in U.S. history -- to go forward as a class action covering as many as 1.6 million current and former Walmart workers. A class-action suit could result in billions of dollars in restitution for institutional bias in hiring and promotion if Dukes and her fellow plaintiffs win the case.

The 10-year-old suit has taken on at least some of the trappings of a Gideon v. Wainwright or a Brown v. Board of Education, where people of humble origins used the courts to force change on powerful institutions.

Dukes, 61, witnessed the hourlong oral arguments in Washington, D.C., and was photographed on the Supreme Court steps with her legal team.

"Seeing those nine judges sitting on the bench was something to behold," she said. "You never know where life is going to take you."

She said the Supreme Court reminded her of a church, with carved wood, velvet curtains and straight-backed benches for spectators. She sat in the third row of the gallery behind her attorneys, separated by a rail.

Dukes was impressed by the court's tight security.

Spectators go through a metal detector, hand over their cameras and cellphones, and store their coats and purses in lockers during the hearings.

She was also interviewed on "The Today Show" and CNN, and updates about the case appeared online and in print worldwide.

One headline posed the question, "Could Betty Dukes and her Co-Plaintiffs be Walmart's Erin Brockovich?"

This week, Dukes was again organizing shopping carts and chatting with customers as a greeter at the Walmart on Loveridge Road where she has worked 17 years.

She said things have settled down at work in the years since she filed the suit.

"Our managers now weren't even working for Walmart when the suit was filed," she said. "It's respectful on my part and their part."

The woman behind the massive suit started out as a part-time cashier with the Pittsburg store in 1994, after about 20 years working for smaller home-improvement retailers, such as Grossman's and Long Star, a concrete and building materials supplier.

She became a full-time cashier a few months later before being promoted to a customer service manager in 1997.

Dukes said she noticed a pattern where men received training for the jobs she wanted on the main floor while women were often ignored.

Dukes said she later learned that a male co-worker was making 50 cents per hour more than she was for doing the same job, even though he had worked at Walmart for a much shorter time.

Her unhappiness with some of the Pittsburg store's managers boiled over in 1999, when she filed a complaint against them after she was demoted to cashier.

"I felt that I was victimized, and I started up the chain of command with upper management to no avail," Dukes said.

"For my own job protection, I sought legal representation."

Dukes said she called attorneys who specialize in labor issues but that many backed off when she mentioned Walmart, telling her that a suit against a company that size would be too expensive.

She was eventually referred to Equal Rights Advocates in San Francisco, which gave her name to her lead attorney Brad Seligman, who heads a Berkeley-based legal aid firm, The Impact Fund.

He described Dukes as "a unique plaintiff" who has become an expert on class-action and appellate law in the past decade.

"She has hung in there for many, many years and done it under the extraordinary circumstances of working for the company she is suing," Seligman said.

Walmart has vigorously denied any companywide discrimination practices and argued to the Supreme Court that Dukes' suit should not be granted class-action status because it would force the company to defend the treatment of female employees regardless of the jobs they hold or where they work.

If the justices rule against the class action -- which many expect based on the conservative makeup of the court and comments they made during oral arguments -- attorneys will still take Dukes' case to trial, Seligman said. The case involves five other named co-plaintiffs, including Christine Kwapnoski, an assistant manager at a Walmart-owned Sam's Club in Concord.

"We're going to go back to San Francisco (federal court) no matter what happens," Seligman said.

Despite the acrimony that led to the suit, Dukes said she has always enjoyed working at Walmart.

"I like being a greeter, a cashier, a customer service manager," she said. "I've always tried to keep myself focused, be effective with my job and do my work to the best."

She said she'll be happy when all the litigation is over.

"When we first filed the suit, I thought it might go on for seven years and (Walmart) would settle," she said. "We didn't take Walmart to the Supreme Court; they took us."

Walmart case may redraw US gender bias, class action rules

A controversial and wide-ranging sex discrimination case against US retailer Walmart is currently wending its way through the country’s highest court.

A 10-year-old case, Walmart v Duke, began with legal action by six women, but could potentially launch America’s largest ever class action involving up millions of American women.

With billions of dollars in back pay and punitive damages at stake for Walmart – North America’s largest private employer and a multinational operating in United Kingdom, Mexico, India and Canada, among others – it’s hardly surprising the case is being closely followed by both American and international companies.

The case also marks an attempt by the Supreme Court to look at the standards for certifying a class action and the possibility of putting tighter restrictions on class-action suits.

Additionally, it will put to the test both the US Supreme Court’s pro-business stance as well as the gender make-up of its judges.

The background

The latest confrontation between the parties commenced in late last month in the United States' most superior court, the Supreme Court. The judgment, expected in June, will set the rules for class action applications for the rest of the country.

The court will determine whether up to 2 million women employed by Walmart can file a sex discrimination lawsuit as one unified group.

If allowed, it would cover any woman who has worked for one of more than 3400 Walmart stores in the US since December 1998.

The saga first began in June 2001 when six female current and former female hourly workers and managers filed an initial suit accusing Walmart of systematically denying women workers equal pay and opportunities for promotion through policies and practices across all their stores.

The company has denied this, saying “the company promotes women employees and pays them well”. Walmart’s lawyer, Theodore Boutrous argues Walmart’s written company policy forbids discrimination, not encourages it and operates under a system of promotion and pay determined by decentralised managers.

An initial decision by District Court in June 2004 granted the case class action status and was affirmed in December 2007 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Walmart has taken the case to the Supreme Court, arguing the claims are too varied to proceed as a single lawsuit.

Common case to answer?

It’s important to remember that the question before the Supreme Court is not whether Wal-Martdiscriminated against the women, but whether the alleged victims have enough in common that their claims can be fairly decided in a single action.

The US Supreme Court is the highest court and is made up of nine judges who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Current opinion suggests that the court might be divided about this case along gender lines, with the three female justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan emerging as possibly more sympathetic to class action, while Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito voiced scepticism on the first day of hearing.

Controversially, it has also been suggested by practicing class action lawyer and academic John ‘Sean’ Coffey that the court may not confine its opinion exclusively to Walmart, but could add ‘pro-business’ language to the law.

The implication of this is that lower courts may use this to ‘chip away’ at the class action device in relation to sexual discrimination in the future.

Columbia University’s political science Professor Dorian Warren also recognises the pro-business stance of the Supreme Court; although the present court make-up of three women is likely to produce some divergent and interesting opinions in this case.

Principles of class-actions

For it’s part, Walmart is arguing the order allowing the class action is harmful to to the “rights of everyone involved” as it “distorts basic principles of class-action and anti-discrimination law”.

The order, Boutrous argues, eviscerates fundamental procedural protections for class-action defendants and allows the rights of millions of absent class members to be extinguished.

The Court has previously recognised the ‘wide gap’ between individualised allegations of discrimination and a company-wide practice that may be challenged in a class action.

To bridge this gap, class plaintiffs must submit “significant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination”. The plaintiffs must answer the threshold issue of whether there is a sufficient nexus between the subjective decision making and output.

In order to answer this question the plaintiffs are relying on three categories of evidence – statistics, sociology and anecdotes. In response, the petitioner argues that the plaintiff has not bridged the wide gap between their own individual assertions and the class-wide claims and using statistical, sociology and anecdotes type of evidence only highlights the lack of commonality required for a class action.

Punitive damages

A further important issue is the plaintiffs’ back pay and punitive damages claims. Boutrous argues the ‘plaintiffs are seeking monetary relief in the form of back pay, as opposed to compensatory damages, does not alter the conclusion that the request for monetary relief is predominate’.

While back-pay is a form of monetary relief that has on occasions been characterised as equitable, according to Boutrous it is nothing more than monetary compensation for past harm.

The importance of this case cannot be underestimated and the legal ramifications for class action applications will finally be clarified by the Court.

What decision the Supreme Court will make will determine whether or not this case goes forward as a class action or as an individual plaintiff action. Everyone continues to watch and wait.

Corporate News: Wal-Mart Settles Suit Over Alleged Ethnic    Harassment

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has agreed to pay $440,000 to settle a lawsuit by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of Mexican immigrant workers at a California Sam's Club who claimed they were harassed about their national origin by a Mexican-American colleague.

The EEOC lawsuit claimed that at least nine employees of Mexican descent, along with another worker married to a Mexican, endured ethnic slurs and derogatory remarks by a colleague.

The agency said the "near daily" insults included remarks that Mexicans were only good for cleaning homes. It said they were reported to superiors at the Sam's Club near Fresno in April 2006 yet went unchecked for months.

"It was very nasty verbal stuff, things we are not used to hearing, especially at work," recalled one of the alleged victims, Sofia Alvarez, 58, who came to the U.S. when she was a year old and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. "We complained to our supervisor and not much was done. This person was a top salesperson who knew her job. We got the picture that they believed whatever she was saying more than us."

Wal-Mart acknowledged the incidents in question but characterized them as an anomaly involving a single employee.

The worker behind the alleged harassment, whose name wasn't disclosed, was fired in December 2006. "Sam's Club has strong policies against discrimination and harassment," said Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Rossiter. "This involved one associate at our Fresno club years ago."

The settlement of the Fresno harassment case comes at a politically sensitive time for the world's largest retailer. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently considering an enormous class-action lawsuit alleging that female Wal-Mart workers were systematically denied equal pay and promotions, the largest such legal matter in U.S. history.

Wal-Mart has vigorously argued that that case shouldn't have class-action status because the alleged victims have too little in common. The company also has denied the claims, saying there was no systematic discrimination against women and no pattern of pay differential on a store-by-store basis.

Melissa Barrios, the head of the EEOC's office in Fresno, said the alleged behavior at Sam's Club went unaddressed too long. She said the complaints, which the agency says were a violation of the Civil Rights Act, had still not resulted in the removal of the employee even after the matter was being investigated by the EEOC. "Sam's Club had been on notice about these particular claims, not only by workers but by the commission, and they were not moving very quickly to take action," Ms. Barrios said.

NEW YORK

— Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is on the defensive once again — and now it wants to play a little offense.

A renewed commitment to apparel, a national ad campaign underscoring its low-price promise, new store formats and a push into urban markets are among the retail giant's latest strategies. And most of them are fraught with pitfalls in one way or another.

The fundamental question is whether these initiatives will be enough to return the world's largest retailer to the growth track in the U.S., where it once again is struggling against the much-smaller Target Corp. Wal-Mart's U.S. stores saw comparable-store sales declines of 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter, their seventh straight drop as the consumers they attracted during the 2008 recession appear to be heading to other retailers now that the economy is improving. Wal-Mart had sales last year of $419 billion, an increase of 3.4 percent over the previous year. For fiscal 2010, Target's sales moved up 3.7 percent to $65.8 billion from $63.4 billion and comps increased 2.1 percent.

Then there are the retailer's legal woes. Wal-Mart by virtue of its size has a steady stream of lawsuits to fend off. In the latest news, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Thursday that Sam's Club will pay $440,000 and furnish other relief to settle a national origin harassment suit filed by the commission. The suit alleged that Mexican-Americans subjected other Hispanic employees to ethnic slurs at a Fresno club. Meanwhile, the long-running class action suit Dukes vs. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. last week was argued in the Supreme Court as to whether it can receive class status. Wal-Mart wants the court to decertify the class. The court has not yet issued a ruling.

Wal-Mart has made a series of missteps over the last two years that it is only now correcting, such as pushing its apparel offering too far toward fashion and eliminating products that had a local customer focus. Retail analysts have been urging the company to pay more attention to apparel, especially as the economy improved and shoppers who had traded down began taking their discretionary income elsewhere. “Apparel continues to be a weakness for Wal-Mart,” said Carol Spieckerman, president of Newmarketbuilders. “Wal-Mart hasn't come up with a compelling brand proposition in apparel [in some time]. Wal-Mart ran screaming away from apparel. Now it's focusing on basics in a trendless environment.”

While the company has had an on-again, off-again relationship with apparel, it appears to have clothing back in its sights. After shifting to a consumables focus in recent years, Wal-Mart said on Tuesday it would bring back brands it had dropped, such as Just My Size full-size, full-figured women's apparel, and assign more space to apparel as it decreases the size of electronics departments.

“The company has struggled with its apparel merchandising for a decade,” said R.J. Hottovy, a retail analyst at Morningstar in Chicago. “It has to hit all the different audiences that frequent Wal-Mart, moms and dads and also have a little more fashion [for juniors]. I don't know if apparel will have an impact in urban stores. As you move into the cities the real focus is going to be on the grocery side of the business.”

In addition to helping consumers understand its low-price promise, part of Wal-Mart's national ad campaign explains that the retailer is returning to shelves 8,500 products that were previously removed, mainly in the food section. Signs in stores reading “It's Back” identify the returned products, which will be on shelves in May. “It seems Wal-Mart is asking its customers for forgiveness and hoping consumers are aware of the changes it made,” said David Strasser, a retail analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott.

That's not the only message Wal-Mart wants to get across. The retailer's battles with community groups continue as it tries to expand into more urban markets, a key part of its growth strategy in the U.S. since its Supercenters already dominate the suburban landscape in most key markets.

Wal-Mart's intentions to open stores in cities such as New York and Chicago have been welcomed by some politicians but haven't been embraced by all. The retailer this week reportedly met with its public relations team about a 30,000-square-foot small-format store proposed for the Lakeview section of Chicago, south of Wrigley Field. “There are organized efforts to keep them out,” said Morningstar's Hottovy. “It was getting very contentious. Wal-Mart's p.r. movement is in effect. What we've seen is that municipalities strapped for cash and tax revenue are more open to welcoming Wal-Mart.”

Hottovy said Minneapolis and Seattle are also markets where Wal-Mart will open small-format stores. “They're testing how the format works,” he said. “They're pretty well saturated in suburban markets. This is the next frontier. It gives them a whole other audience. It's a multiyear process.”

But Wal-Mart's opponents —particularly those in urban markets it is now aiming to enter —are once again becoming more vocal as they battle the world's largest retailer and its expansion plans.

Wal-Mart has been campaigning to open a store in New York City for more than a year. After its attempt in 2005 to open a store in Rego Park in Queens was thwarted, the retailer is determined to win this time. The company has reportedly set its sights on The Related Cos.' Gateway II shopping center expansion in the East New York section of Brooklyn. The retailer has been pulling out the advertising and marketing stops, commissioning polls and studies in the hope of winning in the court of public opinion.

Its efforts in New York unleashed opponents including local politicians, advocacy groups and community leaders that cite the retailer's negative impact on small businesses and what critics claim is low pay for employees. On Wednesday, a meeting of the New York Department of Housing Preservation and Development to discuss the land transfer to Related for Gateway II — one of the last stages before the developer can begin constructions, — was sprinkled with questions from New York Jobs for Justice, a labor community coalition. “We were hoping ultimately to educate Related on the impact [Wal-Mart would] have on East New York,” said John Kest, director of Urban Agenda and New York Jobs for Justice. “We were trying to bring up technicalities related to the appraisal.”

Wal-Mart Free New York has taken its campaign from the steps of City Hall to the halls of academia, where “Sweatshop, Warehouse, Wal-Mart: A Worker Truth Tour” was held this month at New York University, featuring a garment worker from Bangladesh whose factory supplies Wal-Mart.

“What we're finding is that some of the louder voices in this debate don't necessarily represent the majority opinion of New Yorkers,” said Steve Restivo, Wal-Mart's director of community affairs. “We're finding that, across the board, the more people that actually get to know the facts about the company, the more they see the value of bringing a Wal-Mart store to their neighborhood. The clear fact is that the overwhelming majority of New Yorkers want Wal-Mart in New York City. We've done a number of polls.”

Restivo said Wal-Mart has “leveraged social and paid media to set the record straight. We've got a petition signed by 80,000 New Yorkers. Our New York Facebook page launched on Feb. 1 has more than 33,000 ‘likes.’ Combine that with editorial support from every leading media outlet in the city.”

But is the time and attention required to navigate the opposition distracting Wal-Mart executives from other pressing issues, such as improving product offerings and fine-tuning assortments?

“The challenges for any developer today in the U.S. are huge,” said Patrick Fox, chairman and chief executive officer of the Saint Consulting Group. “You have growing opposition to projects. People realize now that they can oppose these projects and win. I call it the Wal-Mart effect, watching Wal-Mart get its butt kicked all across the country, people have seen so many projects defeated that they've become emboldened. Social networking makes it easier to organize and you've got a lot more people showing up. There's passion and anger, and that manifests itself in public hearings. People who live near these proposed sites are worried about how it will affect them. Ninety percent of the community may favor the project, but the abutters show up and that's all the local officials see.”

The retailer's foes are more sophisticated and better organized than ever. Casie Yoder of Making Change at Wal-Mart said her group's efforts are “absolutely having an impact. The fact that Wal-Mart feels the need to send mailers and run TV ads in the most expensive market in the country tells you they feel they have something to defend. The conversation is changing from where Wal-Mart wants it to be. Wal-Mart likely wants to build 50 to 100 units to gain market share. Yes, you can find existing ‘as-of-right’ sites [that don't require city council approval] for your first couple stores, but if you're talking about dozens of stores you need the city council.” While Wal-Mart has announced smaller-format stores, Yoder said, “They're kind of unproven and we haven't seen how they impact the community.”

While New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been supportive of Wal-Mart opening in Brooklyn, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn has been a loud anti-Wal-Mart voice, along with Charles Barron, the councilman from the district where Gateway II is located.

Asked whether Wal-Mart has made an effort to meet with unions here, Restivo said, “We have not in New York.”

“It benefits Wal-Mart to get into a community early and have some political support lined up,” said Saint Consulting's Fox. “It should be reaching out to neighbors and activists. You can see if you can build a project in such a way that can earn their support.”

Wal-Mart tried that approach, in Inglewood, Calif. in 2004 and it backfired. After the City Council rejected Wal-Mart's proposal for a Supercenter, the retailer got 6,500 signatures for a ballot initiative. Wal-Mart's campaign included free meals for citizens. But 60.6 percent of residents voted against Wal-Mart.

“Wal-Mart is changing its store prototypes and the size of its facilities,” Fox said. “They're trying to make it easier to get their stores approved. Years ago, Wal-Mart would just try to push through into a community. If they ran into opposition, they went to the next town. What happened was, they ran out of towns. Now they're doing more outreach, gathering petitions of supporters and demonstrating that support to local officials. Wal-Mart is so large that anywhere it goes it needs some kind of approval. It could be from the health department or the highway department. For Wal-Mart, New York is a site-by-site fight. Wal-Mart has a tough fight anywhere it goes. All of these people will shop at Wal-Mart as long as it's somewhere else.”

Wal Mart Stores Inc. will pay $440,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission based on the complaints of Mexican immigrant workers at a Sam’s Club in California about being harassed about their national origin by a Mexican American coworker. According to the lawsuit, at least nine employees of Mexican descent and another worker married to a Mexican were subjected to ethnic insults from a coworker almost every day. In a complaint, one of these workers said that the problem was brought to the attention of a supervisor, who did little to correct the situation. Wal Mart acknowledged the validity of the complaints but characterized the problem as an anomaly involving only one employee.

Executive Summary

Technological innovations have introduced a host of new legal questions to the employment law area. Thanks to computer and mobile technology, workforces are increasingly virtual and global, creating new tensions in labor law compliance, particularly when it comes to wage-and-hour requirements. Furthermore, the use of social media by employees, employers, and labor unions continues to raise new practical and legal issues.

Our panel of experts from Northern and Southern California discusses these trends, as well as notable cases such as Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (603 F.3d 571 (9th Cir. 2010) cert granted, 131 S.Ct. 795 (2010)), Laster v. AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, (584 F.3d 849 (9th Cir. 2009), cert granted sub nom. AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 130 S.Ct. 3322 (2010)), and Brinker Restaurant Corp. v. Superior Court (165 Cal. App. 4th 25 (2008)(now pending before California Supreme Court)). They are Steven Blackburn and Betsy Johnson of Epstein, Becker & Green; Dan McCoy and Victor Schachter of Fenwick & West; Garry Mathiason of Littler Mendelson; Ken Sulzer of Seyfarth Shaw; and Pam Teren of the Teren Law Group. California Lawyer moderated the roundtable, which was reported by Laurie Schmidt of Barkley Court Reporters.

Moderator: What are the legal issues addressed by recent wage-and-hour litigation and court decisions?

Blackurn:b One important decision pending before the California Supreme Court—among several in the wage-and-hour law arena that are going to have significant impact—is Sullivan v. Oracle Corp. (557 F.3d 979 (9th Cir. 2009)(question certified to California Supreme Court)). The court will decide whether a California-based employer must apply the California Labor Code to out-of-state employees when they travel into the state on business. The nearly uniform practice, of course, has been for employers to pay employees according to the law of the state in which they reside, even if they spend substantial time in California. The logistical aspects of requiring an employer to apply different wage-and-hour principles to employees who travel into a state for a short period are immense. But it is easy to see good arguments on both sides. For example, looking at laws related to smoking in the workplace, arguably it's reasonable to assume that out-of-state employees who work temporarily in California could be bound by the state's anti-smoking provisions. Should wage-and-hour laws similarly apply, depending upon where the work is being performed?

Schachter: Oracle is just one case addressing our increasingly mobile workforce. The court in Narayan v. EGL, Inc. (616 F. 3d 895 (9th Cir. 2010)) took another approach. That case involved a Texas company with California employees who worked in a California facility. The Ninth Circuit found that for employees located in California, the California Labor Code applies, and it disregarded a Texas choice-of-law provision in the employment agreements.

In the case of Holliday v. Lifestyle Lift, Inc. (No. 09-4995 (N.D. Cal. filed Oct. 20, 2010)), executives were charged with creating a policy denying overtime to all non-exempt workers. The California employees sued an executive, a resident in Michigan, in California courts. The court ruled there was personal jurisdiction because there were sufficient contacts between the executive and California through phone calls and visits.

Johnon:s On the flip side, I have a client, a California-based nationwide company that had an employee who relocated back East, where the firm has offices. But the employee still did most of his work in California. In laying off the employee, the question was: Is he a New York employee subject to New York law regarding payout of vacation and termination, or is he subject to California law? The mobile workforce does create issues that the laws were never intended or drafted to deal with.

Mathiaon:s These cases illustrate that we have employment laws—especially wage-and-hour laws—often manufactured decades ago that are being contorted to fit the current environment. A growing part of the workforce in California may never set foot in California. We have typically applied the law of the physical location of the individual performing the work. Increasingly, technology is making this standard obsolete. With legislative action politically deadlocked, courts are being called upon to balance the new world of work with the original intent of the statutes.

Sulzer: A number of wage-and-hour issues arise in the telecommuting context as well, particularly as we wait for the Brinker decision regarding meal and break periods, and whether they must be "ensured" or "provided."

On the flip-side of this, there is a new kind of class action involving employees who are the least mobile—class actions under the labor code related to "suitable seating" for workers. Bright v. 99 Cent Only Stores (189 Cal. App. 4th 1472 (2010)) brought this issue to our attention, and now a plaintiff can sue under the Private Attorney General Act of 2004 (Cal. Lab. Code §§ 2698–2699.5) for recovery. We've seen this in the retail and hospitality industries, but now other industries are concerned about exactly what this trend means. A number of them are looking for an ergonomic defense whereas, in the hospitality or retail industry, there's another defense, which is that if you are customer facing, standing—not sitting—is part of the job.

McCoy: You'll also see these cases in white-collar working environments, such as biotech labs. Sophisticated counsel will take these cases into the high tech sector in the same way that overtime misclassification cases evolved from retail and fast food to high tech.

Johnon:s The seating cases are an example of the plaintiffs bar getting more creative with the types of claims they are bringing since the low-hanging fruit has already been plucked. Section 15 of most wage orders require employers to provide a comfortable temperature in the workplace; that could be the next wave of class action litigation. We're getting into the weeds on a lot of the less visible issues in the wage-and-hour area.

Mathiaon:s Plaintiffs counsel are mining micro-inequities in the labor code. All of this is driven by the attraction of class action status, the significant costs for litigation, and therefore, the significant settlement value. This will continue until the courts make these kinds of classes hard to certify and they grant more summary judgments.

Teren: As a plaintiffs lawyer and an employee rights advocate, I prefer cases where I'm empathetic about the situation, or where it's an issue that I care about. As a general matter, seating and temperature don't make the cut for me; they also don't seem to have much jury appeal. There are just too many serious abuses I am dealing with in my practice.

Sulzer: With plaintiffs looking for different types of class actions to pursue, we frequently see claims based on time rounding. Judges are looking closely at that, and restricting the de minimis argument. Plaintiffs use Rutti v. LoJack Corporation, Inc. (596 F.3d 1046 (9th Cir. 2010)) to say, "There's no such thing as de minimis in California anymore. If you underpay somebody by two minutes, you owe them two minutes, plus penalties.

Schachter: In that regard, an enormous area of potential litigation involves employees checking emails on mobile devices. If somebody does that for a minute here and there, to what extent do these di minimis involvements with the workplace trigger an obligation to pay overtime?

Mathiaon:s There's a need for a di minimis standard under both state and federal wage-and-hour law. If the employer's policy does not require off-duty email monitoring, 15 minutes would be a reasonable di minimis standard. But there needs to be a standard.

Sulzer: It is lawful under the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. §§ 201–219). The way the de minimis rule develops may depend on how many of these cases are removed to federal court where resources allow more decisive rulings and federal law as a guide.

McCoy: It will be difficult to establish a clear de minimis rule; these are fact-specific cases. The harder cases are those, for example, where a manager has an implied understanding with an assistant about checking email during off hours, just in case there's something that needs urgent attention. The employer will have a difficult time obtaining summary judgment in those circumstances. What it comes down to is that employers need to train managers about the risk they create for the business when they set these kinds of work expectations for their non-exempt staff.

Teren: On the flip side of cases where the employer is supposedly "stealing time" through time rounding, there are cases where the employer will require an employee to arrive 20 minutes to an hour before their shift, but not allow them to clock-in. That happens in restaurant cases because the employer wants to see what the flow of business is. That's unfair to employees.

Blackurn:b In my experience, one of the most common causes of non-compliance with wage-and-hour laws has been employee preference—they don't want to take lunch because that lengthens their work hours, or they want to check their BlackBerry at home, or very commonly, they don't want to be considered a non-exempt employee. Another case that could have some significant consequences is Liberty Mutual (Harris v. Superior Court (Liberty Mutual Ins.), 154 Cal.App.4th 164 (2007), hearing granted by California Supreme Court, 171 P.3d 545 (Cal. 2007)), which will take up the administrative exemption. Will the court adopt the administrative-production dichotomy? The administrative exemption is a very important one for employers and is very difficult to apply.

Schachter: There is some good news: In Hodge v. AON Insurance Servs. (2011 WL 311169), workers' comp adjusters were found to be exempt. The court rejected the administrative-production dichotomy, which will become a trend. As courts start dealing with these issues, they are going to appreciate the realities of the workplace.

Johnon:s This makes it difficult to advise clients when they do their internal audits for compliance purposes. When looking at all these job classifications, who should be considered administratively exempted? Even if we have judicial or legislative focus on this, it is still going to be difficult to say with 100 percent certainty that an employee is considered exempt under state or federal law.

Sulzer: The exemption issue has been around for a good 15 years in the class action area. Another issue that's been around for many years is independent contractors. Because of the economy, a number of companies laid off a substantial number of people and now use more independent contractors. Accordingly, we have seen an increase in class action challenges to independent contractor status. Betsy [Johnson] brought up audits, and many clients are now looking at whether their independent contractors are properly classified.

Mathiaon:s There is a push toward a free agent-type of workforce, which draws people toward becoming independent contractors with more flexible work schedules. Simultaneously, there is a movement by the government to find revenue. The Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) have made it a priority to challenge independent contractor status, and 14 states tightened the classification standards. Organizations are going to need to do audits and careful monitoring of their contingent workforces.

McCoy: The independent contractor issue is back, although less in the context of class actions, and more in terms of administrative enforcement. In California, the Employment Development Department is aggressively auditing my clients, both randomly, as well as in response to claims for unemployment that contractors make when their contracts end.

Moderator:Brinker will come out? How do you predict

Teren: From a plaintiff's point of view, the ruling that's up for review weakens employees' rights. Brinker essentially found breaks are optional; I read the decision as saying that there could literally never be a situation where a class action for a failure to provide breaks could occur. I used to represent employers, and sometimes still do, and the courts need to find a balance between establishing that breaks are important and not making it a policing situation for employers.

Sulzer: My suspicion is the decision is going to be similar to Sav-on Drug Stores, Inc. v. Superior Court (34 Cal. 4th 319 (2004))—discretion is given to the trial judge, but they will not decide the issue for us, other than perhaps in certain contexts.

Johnon:s In the years since Brinker has been pending in the state Supreme Court, nuanced issues in the meal and rest break area have arisen that aren't even addressed in Brinker. So it is not going to end the litigation on meal and rest periods.

Mathiaon:s Brinker is an opportunity for the state Supreme Court to take a bold stand in favor of common sense and the plain meaning of the statute. Meal- and rest-break class actions cost millions of dollars to litigate, and for that reason alone are often settled. Thereafter, it is common for only 10 to 15 percent of the class to actually make claims. If employers "provide" the breaks and employees voluntarily decline to take them, this is what the Legislature intended. It is demeaning to assume an exempt employee can decide to take breaks, but a non-exempt employee is incapable of making similar decisions. Something is wrong when more money is spent on litigating meal- and rest-break cases than discrimination claims.

Teren: However, what tends to happen is there's an incentive to not take breaks during the middle of the day because the employees want to get their work done and leave. On the other hand, I have represented individuals with low blood sugar who work in restaurants that did not allow them to take necessary eating breaks, and they suffered long-term health effects. The Legislature thinks breaks are important enough for them to include a break requirement in the labor code, so they should be enforced. That requirement must be balanced with the practicality of the enforcement, but just giving lip service about providing a break means that in reality, no one will take a break, and that's a problem.

Schachter: There is a problem if there is an abuse of that policy, but it's not a question of ensuring; it's a matter of bad practice. Companies want to provide the opportunity, but they want to do it in a way that their operations can function. I predict Brinker will uphold company policies that provide an opportunity for a break, and they will not need to ensure it.

Blackurn:b From both a policy and political standpoint, Brinker is teed up to be a gray decision, not a black-and-white decision. I could see the court taking into account all of the various considerations, and applying something akin to a variation of the totality of the circumstances standard that has been a source of great aggravation for all of us over the years, and which could present some profound complications for class certification issues around the question of commonality.

McCoy: I would hope that the general rule will be that employers need to provide and not ensure; the rulings from the lower court certainly support that conclusion.

Moderator: What trends are you seeing related to arbitration agreements in the employment context?

Mathiaon:s Following Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp. (500 U.S. 20 (1991)), the use of employee arbitration agreements has expanded to cover nearly a quarter of the California workforce. The legal standard for the enforceability of these agreements has been increasingly clarified to include multiple due process requirements. A current question is whether such agreements can preclude class actions or class arbitrations. Applying the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1–16), the U.S. Supreme Court in Stolt-Nielsen (Stolt-Nielsen SA v. AnimalFeeds Int'l Corp., 130 S.Ct. 1758 (April 27, 2010)), held that the affirmative consent of the parties was needed for class arbitration. Almost no agreements provide for class arbitration, and many require arbitration of disputes as opposed to joining a class action. For wage-and-hour class actions in California, our Supreme Court in Gentry (42 Cal.4th 443 (2007)) has limited the ability of arbitration agreements to preclude participation in class actions in various circumstances, including when employees reasonably fear retaliation or lack knowledge of their rights. Arbitration agreements that are unconscionable or exculpatory of unwaivable employee rights are not enforced under California law.

Now, the U.S. Supreme Court has before it AT&T Mobility, which tests whether a state court ruling disallowing class action waivers as part of an arbitration agreement is preempted by the FAA. An organization with arbitration agreements needs to keep current with the due process requirements and legislative attempts to preclude their use. A portion of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub. L. No. 111–203; see 18 USC Section 1514A(e)(2)), and a portion of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2010 (Pub. L. No. 111–118; see § 8116), restrict the use of employee arbitration agreements.

Sulzer: As a practical matter, the California courts seem increasingly hostile toward arbitration agreements. There are appellate cases such as Trivedi v. Curexo Technology Corp. (189 Cal. App. 4th 387 (2010)) and Sonic-Calabasas A, Inc. v. Moreno (2011 WL 651877) that nitpick at arbitration agreements. On top of that, I see numerous motions to compel arbitration in L.A. Superior Court. Some judges just seem hostile to plainly enforceable arbitration agreements that comply with Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (24 Cal. 4th 83 (2000)).

McCoy: Sonic-Calabasas is going to be a key part of any discussion I have with a client about the pros and cons of arbitration. The inability to short-circuit a Berman hearing is significant.

Teren: When it comes to unconscionability, there's no real choice for an employee; if someone wants the job, they're going to sign the agreement. The Legislature needs to add a law that creates a cause of action that says you can sue for not being hired or getting fired for refusing to sign an arbitration agreement if there is to be a real choice regarding arbitration.

Also, the selling point of an arbitration agreement is that it is supposedly faster, cheaper, and more efficient. But all of my cases that go to arbitration take up to three times as long because the arbitrators are so willing to accommodate extensions. Arbitration agreements are a tremendous benefit to employers. They remove virtually any risk of punitive damages, overall damage awards are far smaller, and they permit long delays. Those are serious disadvantages for the plaintiff that in and of themselves would arguably make arbitration agreements substantively unconscionable.

McCoy: There's one advantage for the plaintiff with respect to arbitration: The likely unavailability of summary judgment. That's in contrast to a superior court case where simply the threat of summary judgment can significantly impact decisions about settlement and a case generally.

Mathiaon:s We have found arbitration to be less expensive and faster than traditional litigation. The key is selecting an arbitrator who is actively involved in the administration of the case. Since juries are not involved, awards are more predictable and therefore, the percentage of cases settled is significantly higher than traditional litigation. While juries play a critical role in our system of justice, the U.S. is almost alone in the world in using a jury to decide an employment case.

Blackurn:b Things have evolved to the point where there is now a substantial question as to whether mandatory arbitration is in the best interest of many employers. Arbitration clauses now include many features that closely resemble the civil litigation processes, which is what employers were trying to get away from in the first place. And there are many disadvantages to arbitration for employers, such as a limited right to appeal and the question of whether you reserve the right to seek appropriate injunctive relief against the employee. My experience has also been similar to Pam [Teren]'s—there's a question as to whether or not it's faster, cheaper, or more fair.

Schachter: It seems that California continues to disfavor arbitration, and it's the U.S. Supreme Court decision in 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett (129 S. Ct. 1456 (2009)), that is more expansive about the use of arbitration. The California cases that just came down: Sonic-Calabasas, Trivedi, and Pearson Dental Supplies, Inc. v. Superior Court (48 Cal 4 th 665 (2010)), knocked out arbitration for procedural or substantive reasons, or a combination of both. With Pearson, the California Supreme Court found an error of law in the arbitration decision, and then set it aside on a statute of limitations issue. I have concerns about whether California courts are prepared to defer to the arbitration process.

Johnon:s I have mixed feelings about arbitration. Generally, if you have a good arbitration provision, it still acts as a deterrent for plaintiffs who don't have strong cases. But the law is still changing, especially in California. In the beginning, after Armendariz, every time we had a new appellate court decision, we ran out to review our arbitration agreements to make sure they complied with that decision, only to have the next decision come down. I would also agree that arbitration is not faster or cheaper, and I've noticed a trend where arbitrators, because there is no right to appeal, tend to split the baby.

Mathiaon:s From everyone's comments, it's clear that arbitration is not strictly a one-sided tool. It is maturing and more arbitrators are becoming familiar with employment disputes.

Moderator:ment law? How has social media affected employ

Johnon:s It's safe to say that the technology is far ahead of the law. What we're facing is similar to arbitration, where everybody initially decided it was a good idea to have a policy and they threw one together. What we're trying to do with our clients now with social media policies is ask them, "What is the purpose of the policy, and how are you going to implement it and enforce it?"

We're also facing the hours-worked issues, with employees spending time during the workday on social media, and not necessarily for business purposes. There was a recent study that said that employees spend approximately ten hours a week during the workday surfing social media. Oftentimes, these are the same people who are claiming that they worked an extra half-hour and now they want overtime for it. There's also going to be some issues with privacy on employer hardware, and monitoring employee use of social media—how far can an employer intrude into the non-work-related social media that employees are engaging in? And then there are issues related to obtaining discovery from social media sites, and using it in litigation.

Sulzer: There was the American Medical Response case that recently settled with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), where a company's social media policy caused the NLRB to issue a complaint for an unfair labor practice because an employee's use of social media can be considered "protected concerted activity." This case shows that the Obama administration and the NLRB understand that unions intend to use social media to reinvigorate the labor movement. (American Medical Response of Conn., Inc., No. 34-CA-12576 (Nat'l Lab. Rel. Bd.))

Schachter: The strong message to our clients from the decision in City of Ontario v. Quan (130 S. Ct. 2619 (2010)) is that the social media policies must be communicated clearly. Though Quan did not decide whether any expectation of privacy was violated, it determined that, because the company had clearly communicated policies, the employer's search of text messages was "not overly intrusive" and therefore lawful. There's also an interesting decision in Holmes v. Petrovich Development Co. (191 Cal. App. 4th 1047 (2011)), where the court of appeal said that employee communications to her attorney on a work computer via work email were not protected by attorney-client privilege.

Blackurn:b Another area I've been interested in is jury selection. People in the courtroom gallery are able to call up all kinds of information on the individual being voir dired using a smart phone. There are some interesting ex-parte contact issues, as well, when attorneys are using social media.

McCoy: Social media is going to continue to make sexual harassment law even more complex. It will create a new dimension and new bases for claims in that area of the law. Further, social media will continue to be used as evidence to defend against overtime claims as well as claims that breaks were denied. It's powerful evidence because this activity can all be tracked.

Teren: I use social media for trial preparation, and I get great cross-examination questions from posts made to social media. Often witnesses will get up on the stand and say something completely different than what they had just said on an open Facebook page that I didn't need a password to review.

In terms of a company's social media policies, one thing to consider, especially in a sexual harassment or whistleblower context, is that the policies can be used against the employer. For example, if the policy says that employers are monitoring social networks, emails or texts, and if there is a manager who is texting sexually-charged messages to their subordinate, the implication to a potential plaintiff is that the employer was aware and tolerated the behavior.

Sulzer: Additionally, what should managers and executives do with respect to their own social media participation? Regulating executives' and managers' use of social media, and educating them on privacy settings, is something that hasn't been discussed nearly enough.

Mathiaon:s As companies become more global, they also need to look at the local laws. About 70 percent of U.S. recruiters check social media profiles of a job applicant, but in Turkey, for example, this can be a criminal offense.

Moderator: What trends are you seeing with regard to corporate whistleblower retaliation cases?

Schachter: I have seen an explosion of filings in these cases, especially from individuals with financial responsibilities in their companies. The Dodd-Frank provisions offer attractive remedies, including double-back pay, jury trials, rights to immediate reinstatement, exemption from mandatory arbitration, and the direct right to sue in federal court. There is no question we will see increasing litigation in this area.

Sulzer: This dovetails into the wage-and-hour area. Under section 1102.5 of the California Labor Code, any employee may say, "I didn't get my meal periods," and it may be a weak case. But if the employee complained about not getting his or her meal periods and then was disciplined or fired, now you've got a retaliation case. I have seen more of that type of case recently.

Mathiaon:s In 2010, the number of charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for retaliation exceeded all other categories, including race discrimination. If there was any doubt about the expansion of protections against retaliation, a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court decision in Thompson v. North American Stainless, L.P. (131 S.Ct. 863 (2011) ended the debate with its recognition of third-party retaliation claims under Title VII.

McCoy: With respect to Dodd-Frank, you now have a significant financial incentive for people to make these complaints—one that does not exist in most other retaliation contexts.

Teren: The reason behind the uptick in cases is the fraud that has happened. Our government is also hurting for money, and it can't afford enforcement; whistleblowers are an effective internal policing mechanism. In California, we have protections for private employees but for many serious issues, public employees are limited to the Whistleblower Protection Act (Cal. Gov't Code §§ 8547–8547.13), which provides a $10,000 fine, and has administrative filing prerequisites, which make these claims less attractive from a plaintiff's perspective. With situations like the City of Bell where there's massive fraud alleged, the government should consider amending the statute to enhance the remedies and to permit common law claims against public entities.

Johnon:s In California, we've had Labor Code section 1102.5 for years; we have a common law claim for whistleblowing in California. Plus various California agencies have whistleblowing and retaliation provisions built in. This is a revived area because of the publicity from Dodd-Frank, and we're going to see an uptick in California state claims for retaliation as well.

McCoy: With section 1102.5, we have a higher burden of proof—a clear and convincing standard that the employer must establish, not a preponderance. That's a profound difference from a common law retaliation claim, and it's one that significantly impacts an employer's ability to obtain summary judgment.

Blackurn:b There are a number of developments in retaliation cases that are becoming a danger area for employers. Garry [Mathiason] alluded to North American Stainless that expanded the range of people who could claim to be victims of retaliation. There is also Kasten v. Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp. (585 F.3d 310 (7th Cir. 2009)) where the court is exploring the range of formality that complaints can take—such as in a passing remark to the supervisor—does that turn a person into a potential victim of retaliation? Have they engaged in protective activity? The decision in Kasten could provide some interesting guidance on what a person needs to do to trigger the retaliation protections of a statute.

Moderator: What additional policy or trends are you watching?

Sulzer: I see more "corporate campaigns" by the labor movement. Unions are using wage-and-hour class actions as a part of an organizing effort. On the employer's side, companies are using social media during union negotiations to counter claims made by unions.

Johnon:s This is the calm before storm, as far as new legislation in California. Next year we're going to see a lot of employment legislation and increased enforcement. It's going to be important for employers in California to take the time to do their internal audits, to look at their policies and practices to make sure that they're in compliance. It's always easier to tweak or add to a policy that's generally compliant then to create one from whole cloth when an amendment or new law comes into effect.

Mathiaon:s President Barack Obama's agency and department appointees have laid the foundation for the launch of regulatory initiatives that will change workplace legal compliance more so than any other force in the last 100 years. From DOL recordkeeping requirements, to the new Health Care Regulations, to NLRB rulemaking on union access, every agency and department is launching initiatives. Monitoring, responding, and complying will be the central challenge of employers for 2011 and 2012. On the state level, there's also a trend toward anti-bullying initiatives. Research suggests that it's more prevalent than sexual harassment. It's a slippery slope because the definition of bullying is unclear. But employer policies can do a lot to prevent these claims.

Teren: The trend in jury verdicts is that there's a recent uptick for plaintiffs. It seems that people currently are more empathetic toward plaintiff cases. I find that juries in general have been much more open to listening to a case and awarding something significant.

Schachter: Dukes v. Wal-Mart, the largest class action lawsuit in the history of employment law, will define in a meaningful way the parameters of class actions with respect to discrimination and wage-and-hour matters. This sex discrimination class action is unprecedented in its size, and depending on how the Supreme Court rules, it could be a great boom or bust for large class actions. And yet, in California, there's Tien v. Tenet Healthcare Corp. (192 Cal. App. 4th 1055 (2011)), where a class asserting wage claims under the labor code was decertified because the court said plaintiffs have to show actual, individualized injury. While we have some conflicting trends, I predict that we're going to see more decertifications if the California courts require individualized proof. Also, we're going to see the continued growth of mediation and self-mediation, where plaintiffs and defense counsel take a step back to figure out how to resolve disputes without formal litigation.

Blackurn:b What's of interest to me are the efforts in several states, most famously in Wisconsin, to pull back on the collective bargaining rights for public employees. This has the potential to change the labor relations climate, and could cast a large shadow over union activity in the private sector. Alternatively, it might reinvigorate the union movement, extending over to the private sector.

McCoy: As hiring picks up, more people are moving around, and that typically means fights over the enforceability of non-competes and non-solicitation clauses. I'm fascinated by Silguero v. Creteguard, Inc. (187 Cal. App. 4th 60 (2010)), where a California court created a new tort claim against an employer that either refuses to hire or terminates an individual subject to a non-compete that is not enforceable under California law because the employer doesn't want to have a fight with a competitor over enforceability. It's a dangerous case that could potentially spawn a lot of litigation.

Employee mobility has certainly impacted this area of the law. Employees can come into California from other states where they were subject to non-competes, and/or they have feet in two different states, or are constantly on the go. The choice-of-law issues in this area have always been significant, but they'll become even more significant as the workforce continues to become more mobile and more virtual.

Mathiaon:s One trend that encompasses all we've discussed is the rapid growth of the contingent workforce. Projected to reach 25 to 35 percent of the total workforce, they present legal challenges in the application of non-competes, privacy standards, union bargaining unit determinations, wage-and-hour requirements, and every major area of employment and labor law. These developments will help shape the practice over the next decade.

* Sam's Club settles EEOC suit for $440,000

* Suit alleged workers of Mexican descent endured slurs

NEW YORK, April 14 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc's Sam's Club settled an ethnic harassment lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which alleged several employees of Mexican descent endured slurs.

Sam's Club, a wholesale chain store, will pay $440,000 to settle the lawsuit, the agency said on Thursday.

The settlement comes as the world's largest retailer is trying to halt the largest class-action sex-discrimination lawsuit in history by female employees who are seeking billions of dollars. That case is before the U.S. Supreme Court.

The EEOC lawsuit involved only one associate accused of harassment at the company's Fresno, California, store several years ago, said Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Rossiter, adding that the associate was subsequently fired.

"Sam's Club has strong policies against discrimination and harassment," Rossiter said. "When the full extent of the allegations was brought to the company's attention, we took them seriously, they were thoroughly investigated and we took immediate action."

At least nine employees of Mexican descent at the Sam's Club in Fresno, including one who was married to a Mexican national, endured the slurs from a Mexican-American co-worker, the agency said.

The EEOC said that since late 2005, the victims were barraged with frequent insults about Mexicans, including references to Mexicans only being good for cleaning the harasser's home.

Press Releases and Statements

FRESNO, Calif. - Sam's Club, the wholesale chain store owned and operated by Walmart, will pay $440,000 and furnish other relief to settle a national origin harassment lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.

The EEOC contends that at least nine employees of Mexican descent at the Sam's Club in Fresno, along with one who was married to a Mexican, endured ethnic slurs and derogatory remarks by a fellow co-worker who is Mexican-American. Since late 2005, the victims were barraged with near-daily insults about Mexicans such as "f----n' wetbacks," and references to Mexicans only being good for cleaning the harasser's home, according to the EEOC. The harasser even threatened to report three of the victims to immigration authorities despite their legal status. The victims and harasser - all female - worked in the demonstration department, serving food samples to customers.

The victims complained about the hostile work environment to management as early as April 2006 to no avail. Instead, the complaints only intensified the harassment and led to intimidation, said the EEOC. Another employee also began deriding a victim for her inability to speak English. It was not until after an official EEOC charge of discrimination was filed in October 2006 that Sam's Club finally discharged the harasser in December 2006.

In May 2009, the EEOC filed its lawsuit in U.S. District Court, Eastern District of California (EEOC v. Walmart Stores, Inc. dba Sam's Club, et al., Case No. 09-CV-00804), claiming that the harassment, and Walmart's failure to appropriately address it, were in direct violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Aside from the monetary relief, the parties entered into a three-year consent decree which requires Walmart to comply with the following at its Sam's Club locations in Fresno and/or Bakersfield, Calif.:

* review and make available its policies against and complaint procedures for national origin discrimination, harassment and retaliation;

* provide training to non-management employees in the Fresno location regarding anti-discrimination laws, including national origin discrimination and harassment;

* provide separate training to management employees in the Fresno and Bakersfield locations which will including training on how to receive, investigate, or report to designated officials complaints of national origin discrimination, harassment and retaliation;

* set up a record-keeping procedure for the Fresno location that provides for the centralized tracking system for such complaints;

* report the handling of such complaints and compliance with the decree to the EEOC; and

* provide neutral references for the victims upon inquiry.

"We commend Walmart for taking the issues of national origin harassment seriously and implementing preventative measures," said Anna Y. Park, regional attorney for the EEOC's Los Angeles District Office, which includes Fresno in its jurisdiction. "A work environment that is free of harassment ensures a more productive and vibrant workplace for all."

Melissa Barrios, director of the EEOC's Fresno Local Office, added, "National origin discrimination remains a serious problem in this region, and it is important to remember that harassment can manifest even within the same ethnic group. Employers failing to take immediate action send a message that such behavior is tolerated, giving license for others to do the same."

According to company information, Walmart Stores, Inc. is an Arkansas-based international retailer, operating more than 8,300 stores worldwide, including Sam's Club warehouses.

The EEOC is the federal agency that enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency's web site at www.eeoc.gov.

FRESNO, Calif. (AP) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has agreed to pay $440,000 to settle a federal harassment lawsuit by 10 employees who say they endured ethnic slurs and derogatory remarks on a daily basis while working at a Sam's Club store in Fresno, Calif.

Wal-Mart owns and operates Sam's Club.

Nine of the lawsuit plaintiffs were of Mexican descent and one was married to a Mexican. The alleged harasser was a Mexican-American co-worker.

The plaintiffs say they first complained in April 2006 but managers failed to address the harassment. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a complaint in October of that year, and the harasser was fired two months later.

The EEOC announced the settlement Thursday.

The agreement also calls for Wal-Mart to review its policies and provide training on discrimination at Sam's Club locations in Fresno and Bakersfield.

FRESNO, Calif., April 14 -- The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued the following news release:

Sam's Club, the wholesale chain store owned and operated by Walmart, will pay $440,000 and furnish other relief to settle a national origin harassment lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency announced today.

The EEOC contends that at least nine employees of Mexican descent at the Sam's Club in Fresno, along with one who was married to a Mexican, endured ethnic slurs and derogatory remarks by a fellow co-worker who is Mexican-American. Since late 2005, the victims were barraged with near-daily insults about Mexicans such as "f----n' wetbacks," and references to Mexicans only being good for cleaning the harasser's home, according to the EEOC. The harasser even threatened to report three of the victims to immigration authorities despite their legal status. The victims and harasser - all female - worked in the demonstration department, serving food samples to customers.

The victims complained about the hostile work environment to management as early as April 2006 to no avail. Instead, the complaints only intensified the harassment and led to intimidation, said the EEOC. Another employee also began deriding a victim for her inability to speak English. It was not until after an official EEOC charge of discrimination was filed in October 2006 that Sam's Club finally discharged the harasser in December 2006.

In May 2009, the EEOC filed its lawsuit in U.S. District Court, Eastern District of California (EEOC v. Walmart Stores, Inc. dba Sam's Club, et al., Case No. 09-CV-00804), claiming that the harassment, and Walmart's failure to appropriately address it, were in direct violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Aside from the monetary relief, the parties entered into a three-year consent decree which requires Walmart to comply with the following at its Sam's Club locations in Fresno and/or Bakersfield, Calif.:

. review and make available its policies against and complaint procedures for national origin discrimination, harassment and retaliation;

. provide training to non-management employees in the Fresno location regarding anti-discrimination laws, including national origin discrimination and harassment;

. provide separate training to management employees in the Fresno and Bakersfield locations which will including training on how to receive, investigate, or report to designated officials complaints of national origin discrimination, harassment and retaliation;

. set up a record-keeping procedure for the Fresno location that provides for the centralized tracking system for such complaints;

. report the handling of such complaints and compliance with the decree to the EEOC; and

. provide neutral references for the victims upon inquiry.

"We commend Walmart for taking the issues of national origin harassment seriously and implementing preventative measures," said Anna Y. Park, regional attorney for the EEOC's Los Angeles District Office, which includes Fresno in its jurisdiction. "A work environment that is free of harassment ensures a more productive and vibrant workplace for all."

Melissa Barrios, director of the EEOC's Fresno Local Office, added, "National origin discrimination remains a serious problem in this region, and it is important to remember that harassment can manifest even within the same ethnic group. Employers failing to take immediate action send a message that such behavior is tolerated, giving license for others to do the same."

According to company information, Walmart Stores, Inc. is an Arkansas-based international retailer, operating more than 8,300 stores worldwide, including Sam's Club warehouses.

The EEOC is the federal agency that enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about the EEOC is available on the agency's web site at www.eeoc.gov.

To the Editor:

Your April 7 editorial ''Wal-Mart v. Women'' should be required reading for those who still think the sexual discrimination lawsuit against Wal-Mart should proceed as a nationwide class action. A class action cannot be certified unless the plaintiffs prove that common issues predominate. Your anecdotes demonstrate that the claims here differ widely in their particulars.

A California woman's claim that she was unfairly denied a raise has nothing in common with that of a Missouri woman objecting that she was not in the same fishing boat with men on a company outing. Any objective practitioner realizes that upholding class certification in the case, Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, would be difficult.

You assert that if class certification is denied, 1.5 million women will have to ''fend for themselves.'' No, they won't. Plaintiffs' lawyers will simply file the thousands of class complaints already drafted in anticipation of the Supreme Court's ruling.

The writer was a senior vice president for human resources at Wal-Mart from 2005 to 2006, after the filing of the Dukes case.

To the Editor:

''When a Lawsuit Is Too Big'' (Week in Review, April 3) does a good job of describing some of the challenges of class actions, leaving, I fear, the suggestion that they should be sharply curtailed. If that were done, large-scale enterprises would become too big to be deterred or punished for wrongdoing.

Individuals have little or no chance to challenge that wrongdoing by themselves.

Joining together in a collective action by bringing a class action is the only way the courts can be used to have the possibility of justice for the members of the collective and, just as important, justice for the wrongdoer in terms of damages sufficient to create incentives to change behavior.

April 12--A 31-year-old man was charged with stealing items from a Wal-Mart in Lower Macungie earlier this month and then throwing rocks at a security officer who chased after him, according to court records.

Alfredo Cancel, of 1059 Livingston St., Bethlehem, did not strike the security officer with the baseball-sized rocks on April 1 because he jumped out of the way, police said.

Cancel fled the scene, but he was easily identified by the store manager since he used to work at the Wal-Mart, at 1091 Millcreek Road, according to court records.

According to court records.

State police were dispatched to the Wal-Mart at 8:19 p.m. on April 1.

Store employees told police that Cancel walked past cashiers with a shopping cart filled with 19 items, including a 40-inch television, valued at more than $1,140, but was stopped at the front of the store by the greeter who asked him to show a receipt.

Cancel couldn't provide a receipt, left the cart and walked out through another exit. A store security officer followed Cancel outside and asked him to come back inside the store. Cancel took off running and picked up two rocks and threw them at the employee.

Cancel got into his vehicle and fled. He was arraigned on Wednesday.

He is charged with robbery, simple assault, harassment and retail theft. He was sent to Lehigh County Prison under $15,000 bail.

The elephant on the doorstep: What Wal-Mart’s arrival will mean to D.C.

After Wal-Mart announced late last year that it had decided on four sites for its first stores in the District, it was no surprise to see unions and advocates for the working class crying foul. Opponents enlisted the help of local businesses and formed grass-roots organizations to hold film screenings, rallies and marches. One group collected 1,200 petition signatures opposing the chain's plans, and last week a protester carried a plastic bag filled with yellow ping-pong balls painted with upside down smiley faces — a mockery of the chain's happy face logo — into the chambers of the D.C. Council to bring attention to local Wal-Mart opposition.

But for the most part the complaints have come in pockets and parcels, not by tidal wave. Many poor people and other longtime residents of the city want to have neighborhood Wal-Marts because they like shopping there. In fact, some District churches organize bus trips for members to visit Wal-Mart stores in the suburbs.

The company says that the four stores it plans would create 1,200 jobs at a time when Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) and city officials are struggling to find work for members of the city's unskilled population. But some studies suggest that Wal-Mart's growth has led to a comparable or even greater loss of jobs and an overall reduction in the wages of retail workers in a given market.

The research has provoked a battle in Chicago, another target for Wal-Mart expansion. Last year, Loyola University Chicago and the University of Illinois at Chicago published a study that found a Chicago Wal-Mart that opened in 2006 created hundreds of jobs but also led to the loss of about 300.

A Chicago Sun-Times editorial, however, said the study "just doesn't add up," and Wal-Mart officials have moved aggressively to discredit it, commissioning their own study and video suggesting that the store led to the creation of more than 400 net new jobs.

Local researchers are paying closer attention to the chain since it announced plans to open on their doorstep.

"There's little empirical evidence of the side of the argument that Wal-Mart, Starbucks and other big employers have the effect of a net loss of jobs" when they open new stores, said Doug Guthrie, dean of the George Washington University School of Business. Guthrie, who is providing informal advice to Gray's administration on how to address the city's high unemployment rate, said there may be negative ancillary effects of Wal-Mart's assault on labor unions but that the city is in "desperate need" of jobs for its residents who are not qualified for many office positions, reflecting a national loss of blue-collar jobs.

"We just are in a situation in which we need low-skill jobs," Guthrie said. "With the loss of manufacturing in this country you need employment across the board."

Wages are another point of contention. Other studies suggest that the opening of Wal-Mart stores leads to an overall reduction in wages of retail workers, research that the company has strongly disputed.

A 2007 study by the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California at Berkeley concluded that one new Wal-Mart store lowered overall retail wages in a county by as much as 0.9 percent, said center chairman Ken Jacobs. Wages of workers in merchandise dropped by 1 percent and those in grocery stores fell 1.5 percent.

"As Wal-Mart has expanded, retail wages have gone down," Jacobs said. Part of the reason is "that other firms reduce wages to compete."

The median wage for retail workers in the District is $10.97, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

"The jobs we will create will be mostly full-time and offer competitive wages, affordable benefits and the chance to build a career," said Wal-Mart spokesman Steven Restivo in an e-mail about the planned D.C. stores. "We're confident that the starting wages at our recently opened store in Alexandria already exceed those offered by unionized grocers in the city and we're always looking for ways to help our associates grow into positions of management."

Martha Ross, who studies the city's workforce as deputy director of Greater Washington Research at the Brookings Institution, said Wal-Mart's immediate effect on jobs and wages was unlikely to be dramatic. "It's possible that over time, Wal-Mart's presence will act to keep retail wages low, since it appears to be part of their business plan to pay low wages," Ross wrote in an e-mail. Because Wal-Mart isn't unionized, she explained, Wal-Mart's level of pay could over time dilute the control of food worker unions whose members work at Safeway and Giant stores, driving down their wages. But in that regard, she pointed out, Wal-Mart would be joining the ranks of Whole Food Market and Target, whose stores are also not unionized.

Wal-Mart appears to have improved its reputation locally before making its entrance. Although Wal-Mart, in a Supreme Court case, faces accusations of widespread discrimination against its female employees, the company's recent willingness to adopt environmentally sustainable practices, vary its urban store designs and provide millions of dollars in local charitable contributions have made it more palatable to locals.

Leigh Riddick, associate professor of finance and real estate at American University, said she appreciated the fact that the chain planned stores in areas of the city with few other shopping options.

"They've clearly made a decision to change their business model to enter urban areas," she said. "Ten years ago if we were having this conversation I would have a different opinion, even five years ago. But they are really a different company in a lot of ways than they used to be."

With its first D.C. stores, Wal-Mart plans to make groceries a hefty portion of its offerings, bringing produce and healthy foods to neighborhoods where they are for the most part not currently available, aligning with local community development efforts.

"We do know that there are places in D.C. that are not well served in terms of retail options, particularly supermarkets, so if Wal-Mart can come in and fulfill those services, then that's important," said Peter Tatian, a senior research associate in the Urban Institute's Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center.

Institute for Women's Policy Research IWPR; IWPR Research Finds Certified Class Action Lawsuits Reduce Employment    Discrimination

2011 APR 11 - (NewsRx.com) -- Drawing on research from an Institute for Women's Policy Research (IWPR) report released, IWPR submitted an amicus brief in support of plaintiffs in their case against Wal-Mart for employment discrimination. On Tuesday, March 29, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc (petitioners) v. Betty Dukes et al (respondents). The plaintiffs allege that decisions about pay and promotions at Wal-Mart were subjective, reflected sex bias, and led to lower earnings and opportunities for women.

The Supreme Court will hear arguments to decide whether the class action was properly certified on the basis of Rule 23(b)(2), which is focused on providing 'injunctive relief'-changes to employment policies and practices introduced as a result of employment discrimination litigation. A new IWPR research report, Ending Sex and Race Discrimination in the Workplace: Legal Interventions That Push the Envelope, finds that injunctive relief in certified class action settlements effectively tackles discrimination and bias in the workplace. The report finds that injunctive relief is a critical but underutilized feature of Title VII that can impact the overall workplace, not only for those who file complaints.

"Title VII has fueled progress for women in the workplace, and an important part of its power is class action, allowing a small group of women to sue on behalf of all similarly situated women," said Heidi Hartmann, President of IWPR. "As our report shows, class action is key to winning systemic change-especially among very large employers like Wal-Mart. Class action helps to balance an unequal power relationship."

The findings are based on a review of injunctive relief in over 500 court-supervised employment discrimination settlements involving alleged sex and/or race discrimination in employment. For the plaintiffs, the cases were settled by either the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, or by private law firms on behalf of certified classes of plaintiffs. For injunctive relief to effectively tackle bias and discrimination it is key that employment decisions are transparent and managers are accountable for the consequences of their actions.

"Having good human resource management and diversity policies is important, yet our study shows that, without clear measurement, policies alone do little to prevent bias and discrimination in the workplace," said Ariane Hegewisch, Study Director at IWPR and lead author of the report. "Monitoring of the gender and race outcomes of policies is essential to making real change."

The report identifies nine sets of measures most likely to create effective change. All certified class action settlements include at least one of these measures, while the majority of other settlements include none.

Over seventy percent of certified class action settlements, compared to five percent of other settlements, mandate the introduction of objective and transparent criteria for job assignments and promotions.

Two-thirds of certified class action settlements, but fewer than one in ten other settlements, mandate the open posting of job vacancies.

Over sixty percent of certified class action settlements, compared to fewer than five percent of other reviewed settlements, mandate the analysis of promotion and compensation decisions for potential sex or race bias.

Certified class action settlements are more likely than other settlements to include measures to hold supervisors accountable for preventing discrimination through appraisal and rewards processes, are more likely to establish objective criteria for recruitment and termination decisions, and more often introduce new training or mentoring opportunities for members of the class.

"It is important to remember that behind each of the cases discussed in the report are individuals who suffered unfair treatment and other indignities in their efforts to earn a living," said Cynthia Deitch, Associate Professor of Women's Studies, Sociology, and Public Policy at George Washington University, and co-author of the report. "They deserve remedies designed to create long-term and sustained challenges to discrimination that monetary damages alone are unlikely to provide."

Ariane Hegewisch, Cynthia Deitch and Evelyn Murphy, Founder and Director of The Wage Project, are the authors of the report, Ending Sex and Race Discrimination in the Workplace: Legal Interventions That Push the Envelope. Funding was provided by the Ford Foundation.

ANALYSIS- Discrimination  case may not go all Wal-Mart's way

NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters Legal) - Oral arguments had barely finished in the Wal-Mart sex-discrimination case at the U.S. Supreme Court when many commentators declared total victory for the retail behemoth. But interviews with legal scholars and civil-litigation experts suggest that the rush to judgment may have been premature, with at least a partial victory for the plaintiffs not out of the question.

The case, Dukes v. Wal-Mart Inc., centers on whether a group of up to 1.5 million current and former Wal-Mart workers was properly certified as a class by U.S. District Court in San Francisco -- a decision that created the biggest such class in U.S. history and that was upheld by the Ninth Circuit in 2007.

Wal-Mart wants the Supreme Court to decertify the class, arguing that Wal-Mart workers in different jobs in 3,800 stores with different managers could not have faced the same pattern of discrimination in pay and promotion decisions, and therefore should not be considered one class. Written broadly, a ruling dismissing the suit could effectively overhaul class certification standards, dimming the prospects for class-action lawsuits of all kinds.

But many experts are expecting a more nuanced result. "Even if they're so inclined, it will be hard (for the Court) to find a way to completely dispose of the suit at this point," said Michael Selmi, a professor of civil rights and employment law at George Washington University Law School in Washington, D.C. "It would be too inconsistent with previous case law. Other options are on the table."

'WOOLY MAMMOTH'

In one potential outcome, the justices could uphold the district court's decision that the plaintiffs potentially have enough in common to qualify as a class, but send it back to the district court to determine which specific rules of civil procedure apply. In this scenario, the court would provide guidance on whether a more stringent certification standard is appropriate. The plaintiffs would then have to begin anew the process of establishing class certification under these requirements, and the lower court could split the class into smaller components.

Such an outcome would be a blow to the plaintiffs, but it would not undermine this or future sex-discrimination lawsuits in a way that throwing out the case would, said Arthur Miller, professor of civil procedure at New York University School of Law. "Remanding the case might enable a district judge to take this monstrous class and subdivide it along rational lines, such as location, job description, or alleged type of discrimination," Miller said. "That way, you wouldn't have what some might call a wooly mammoth."

During the March 29 oral argument, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer hinted at another possible ruling: The court could uphold certification of the class and allow for possible injunctive relief, but not back pay or punitive damages. In this scenario, the case would return to the district court, where plaintiffs would argue that Wal-Mart must clarify how it makes pay and promotion decisions and ensure that managers are held accountable for their decisions. Plaintiffs would have to pursue monetary claims separately. Such a ruling would make it more difficult, but not impossible, to recover back pay in class-action suits.

JUSTICE THOMAS A 'WILD CARD'

To be sure, Justice Anthony Kennedy, often the deciding vote when the Court splits on ideological lines, expressed deep skepticism about the plaintiffs' case. "Your complaint faces in two directions ... it seems to me there's an inconsistency there, and I'm just not sure what the unlawful policy is," Kennedy told Joseph Sellers, a partner at Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, who argued for the plaintiffs.

Kennedy's questioning -- along with acerbic comments by Justice Antonin Scalia -- led many observers to declare that the plaintiffs' case could be doomed. "My sense from the oral arguments is that Kennedy and others may be preparing to deliver an opinion that will have implications beyond plaintiffs in the Dukes case," said Katherine Kimpel, a partner at Sanford Wittels & Heisler who served as lead counsel for the plaintiffs in the Velez v. Novartis sex-discrimination case, which resulted in the largest-ever U.S. employment discrimination verdict.

Kennedy may have tipped his hand, but the justices may not all end up voting as expected, said Alexandra Lahav, a civil-procedure expert and law professor at the University of Connecticut. Clarence Thomas, is a "wild card," Lahav argued, pointing to a 2002 ruling in another employment-discrimination case, Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, in which Thomas upheld the plaintiff's complaint and articulated a fairly low bar for bringing employment-discrimination lawsuits.

A statistical analysis of sex-discrimination cases before the high court also suggests that plaintiffs tend to fare well, though defendants in recent years have won several high-profile cases. Not including disability cases, plaintiffs prevailed in approximately 70 percent of all employment-based discrimination cases in the last two decades, according to research conducted by George Washington University's Selmi. The Wal-Mart case is also the first major sex-discrimination case before a Supreme Court that includes three women.

Theodore Boutros, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who made the oral argument for the defense, did not return an e-mail requesting comment on the case. Greg Rossiter, a spokesman for Wal-Mart, said the company declined to comment.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs, for their part, said they are prepared for a mixed result. "There is likely to be a nuanced resolution to this case," Sellers said in an interview. "The Court has a lot of options; it could go with us in one way and against us in another."

Retailer gets sympathetic ear at U.S. court; Protesters rally at hearing to decide if suit can proceed

Wal-Mart got a sympathetic hearing from several Supreme Court justices last week as the retailer sought to prevent female employees from bringing the largest class-action sex-discrimination lawsuit in history.

The justices sharply questioned whether more than a million female employees can join together against Wal-Mart Stores Inc., accused of paying women less and giving them fewer promotions.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, a moderate conservative who often casts the decisive vote on the nine-member court, said, "I'm just not sure what the unlawful policy is."

Another justice, Antonin Scalia, said he felt "whipsawed" by the plaintiffs' argument and said they had not made clear whether it was Wal-Mart's corporate culture or local store managers who were allegedly at fault.

"Which is it?" he asked.

Scalia questioned if it would be fair to the company, the world's biggest retailer, for the case to proceed. "Is this really due process?" he asked.

Potentially liability could reach billions of dollars.

But even if Wal-Mart loses at the Supreme Court and then at trial, financial analysts said the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company has more than enough cash to make a big payout with little impact on its profits.

A crowd of protesters gathered outside the court, shouting, "Fair Pay Now" and carrying signs with slogans such as Stop Discounting the Women of Wal-Mart" and "The women of Wal-Mart are not worthless."

Chris Kwapnoski, a 24-year Wal-Mart employee and one of the named plaintiffs in the case, told reporters after the arguments, "We're not going to lose."

She recalled being told by a manager to "brush the cobwebs off" and "doll up" if she wanted advancement.

"Wal-Mart is trying their level best to keep us out of court so the facts will not be presented to the public at large or before a sitting jury," said Betty Dukes, a Wal-Mart employee in Pittsburg, California, who first filed a lawsuit against the retailer in 2001.

Gisel Ruiz, a Wal-Mart executive vice-president, said after the arguments, "We continue to have strong anti-discrimination policies in place, a strong record of advancement of women, and we are always looking to be better."

The U.S. court is likely to make a ruling by late June. The decision could change the legal landscape for workplace and other class-action lawsuits, affecting a similar case against Costco Wholesale Corp.

Businesses say a Wal-Mart defeat could make every large corporation vulnerable to sweeping allegations of employment bias and would water down class-action requirements.

The Supreme Court is deciding only whether the lawsuit can go to trial as a group.

If the court rejects the class-action status, the individual women still can sue, both sides in the case say.

Large class-action lawsuits make it easier for big groups of plaintiffs to sue corporations, and they have led to huge payouts by tobacco, oil and food companies.

Wal-Mart's lawyer, Theodore Boutrous, said female employees in different jobs and in different stores do not have enough in common to be in a single class-action lawsuit.

"It's not fair to anyone to put this all into one big class," he told the justices, adding that the company has a strong policy against discrimination.

Joseph Sellers, a lawyer for the women, argued the class-action lawsuit should be allowed to go to trial for a decision on the merits of the claims.

"This is an extraordinary case," he said.

Women's groups have said a Wal-Mart victory could signal a significant retreat for women's rights in the workplace.

Companies have sought to limit such lawsuits to individual or small groups of plaintiffs.

The Supreme Court, with a conservative majority, has often agreed.

Sanford Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan said he estimates a settlement could cost roughly $1.5 billion.

That equates to 26 cents per Wal-Mart share, or less than 0.5 per cent of the company's current share price.

He said Wal-Mart could "easily" fund that through existing liquidity or free cash flow, with less than one-per-cent impact on its earnings per share.

Chief Justice John Roberts cited Wal-Mart's policy against discrimination and asked whether its pay disparity between men and women was less than the U.S. average.

Larry Downing, Reuters / A protest sign against Wal-Mart is displayed while class action lawsuit Dukes v. Wal-Mart was being argued inside the Supreme Court in Washington. Several U.S. Supreme Court justices sharply questioned whether female employees at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. can proceed with the largest class-action sex- lawsuit in history that seeks billions of dollars.;

Lawyers look for profits in Walmart

There is a case before the Supreme Court now that, if decided on behalf of the plaintiffs, would make some lawyers very, very wealthy, even though it would damage consumers, workers and one of the best companies in America while violating principles of fair play and sound law. But what the heck? That's the American way, right? Yes, of course it is, at least if you look at much of what's been happening in our courts over the years, with average Americans out a pile of money owing to outcomes that in many instances are questionable, to say the least.

But please, please, kind justices, just say no this time out, telling the lawyers that they will not be allowed to pursue a class-action, self-enriching bamboozlement in which Walmart could be forced to pay something like a million and a half women recompense based on the claims of seven people.

The case goes like this. The seven women, who have gotten the nod to proceed in lower courts, say they were not treated equally withmen in promotions and pay, and the lawyers say the same is true of every woman who has worked for Walmart since 1998.

They would like to sue on behalf of the whole crowd, potentially getting payments for one and all and a percentage of the haul for themselves, on the ground that research shows women don't fare as well as men at the fabled retail firm. They agree there was no companywide rule dictating anything nasty at the 3,400 outlets, but say loose controls and a culture of male privilege amount to the same thing.

Observers cite a number of problems. Justice is only justice when defendants can answer specific accusations with evidence of their own. In this suit, many women who faced no workplace impediments would be on the victims' list. The store has stats refuting the drift of plaintiff stats and it has anti-discriminatory policies, to boot.

What's more, it's said, if this suit is allowed to go forward, it will mean other big companies in America can be similarly sued via class action - and they all will be, leading to settlements to avoid the possibility of runaway, wholly ruinous jury verdicts. The billions from Walmart would be just step one down the golden road.

Walmart would be a good place to start because it is so hated, or is it? By the left, yes, but not by the 100 million who shop in the outlets every week, mostly folks of limited means who thereby save what's been estimated at $100 billion a year, an extraordinary living-standard boon they appreciate even if it makes the hoity-toity yawn.

The nation's largest private employer, the company also hires 1.4 million people who are often supplementing family incomes and sometimes living in situations in which extra benefits come from spouses or parents, according to one commentary. While they aren't going to get rich at this work even as they advance, an analyst for the Cato think tank points out that if they could do better elsewhere, they would obviously go elsewhere.

If the Supreme Court says yes to the class action, and the lawyers get a major settlement, Walmart would survive, but the company would likely have to retreat, maybe reducing outlets and workers, making life worse for both men and women employees while making life less bargainhappy for low-income Americans. The only ones coming out ahead would be the lawyers, who, in addition to such civil law suits, have brought tort actions that cost the average consumer something equal to an extra 10 percent tax on wages, according to the Pacific Research Institute.

I know some of those suits are justified and reasonable, but many aren't, and I can't help wishing these lawyers could get a taste of their own medicine and face the chance of a devastating class action suit themselves.

Alas, it's just a dream.

Originally published 30 March 2011

Yesterday the Supreme Court heard oral argument in Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., a case that may become a landmark ruling in class action litigation. Dukes is the most important class action case to reach the Supreme Court in decades because it gives the Court an opportunity to examine — and curb — potential abuses of the class action device. The sheer size and breadth of the class certified by the District Court and upheld by the en banc Ninth Circuit — roughly 1.5 million women employed at any Wal-Mart store in the United States since 1998 — underscore the importance of the case to businesses facing possible class action litigation.

Anticipated Issues

In seeking certiorari, Wal-Mart asked the Court to review whether the class claims for back pay — which could amount to more than a billion dollars — were properly certified under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Supreme Court granted review on that question, but it also posed a question of its own: Whether the class even satisfied the threshold requirements of Rule 23(a).

Rule 23(a) issue. To be certified, a class must meet the requirements of Rule 23(a), which include: (1) numerosity, i.e., that joinder of all class members would be impracticable; (2) commonality, i.e., that class members share common questions of law or fact; (3) typicality, i.e., that claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims and defenses of the class; and (4) adequacy, i.e., that the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). Each of these four conditions must be met in order for a class to go forward.

Rule 23(b)(2) issue. In addition to meeting the requirements of Rule 23(a), a class must also satisfy one of the three elements of Rule 23(b). The only element remotely applicable to this class is Rule 23(b)(2), which provides that a class may be certified only if "the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief...is appropriate respecting the class as a whole." By the Rule's express language, Rule 23(b)(2) class certification "does not extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominately to money damages." That raises considerable problems for this class because, in addition to seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, the class also sought potentially billions of dollars in back pay. The Ninth Circuit had nevertheless affirmed the class under Rule 23(b)(2) based on its application of a new multi-factor predominance test. Under that test, a court considers several factors to determine whether monetary damages "predominate" over the injunctive relief with which Rule 23(b)(2) is traditionally concerned. This new standard created a three-way circuit split. The Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits apply an "incidental damages" test that prohibits certification under Rule 23(b)(2) unless the monetary relief "is incidental to requested injunctive or declaratory relief." Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Group, 151 F.3d 402, 415 (5th Cir. 1998). And the Second Circuit examines whether, "even in the absence of a possible monetary recovery, reasonable plaintiffs would bring the suit to obtain the injunctive or declaratory relief sought" for Rule 23(b) certification. Robinson v. Metro-North Commuter R.R., 267 F.3d 147, 164 (2d Cir. 2001).

Oral Argument Focus

Rule 23(a) requirements. In yesterday's oral argument, the Court focused on whether plaintiffs had satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a) by sufficiently showing that a Wal-Mart policy translated to local discriminatory acts against women. Counsel for Wal-Mart, Theodore J. Boutrous, Jr., argued that plaintiffs' "incoherent" theory — that delegation of excessive discretion to managers caused a corporate policy of discrimination — cannot meet the requirements of Rule 23(a). When Justice Kagan asked Mr. Boutrous whether complete subjective discretion could be a policy in and of itself, as the Court held in Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977 (1988), Mr. Boutrous conceded that it could. But Mr. Boutrous countered that plaintiffs' theory was not such a case because plaintiffs impossibly argue that Wal-Mart personnel decisions are both totally discretionary and informed by company values.

Joseph M. Sellers, counsel for the plaintiffs, faced harsh questioning from several justices on this very point. Justice Kennedy told Mr. Sellers that the plaintiffs' theory of the case "faces in two directions," contains an "inconsistency," and that he was "just not sure what [] unlawful policy" plaintiffs' claim Wal-Mart has adopted. Justice Scalia similarly commented that he was "getting whipsawed," since on the one hand, plaintiffs argue that personnel decisions were utterly subjective, and on the other hand, argue that Wal-Mart's strong corporate culture guides decisions. Justice Scalia also noted that Wal-Mart has a written policy against sex discrimination and wondered if that had no value. Justice Roberts added to this line of questioning and doubted whether plaintiffs' examples of discrimination can establish a common policy of discrimination or whether such examples are just a few "bad apples."

Rule 23(b)(2) monetary remedy availability. Justice Sotomayor briefly questioned Mr. Boutrous about whether plaintiffs could be subdivided into a Rule 23(b)(2) class and Rule 23(b)(3) class — where damages may be awarded but certification is much harder to satisfy. Mr. Boutrous responded that plaintiffs' claims would fail under either standard but that classes should be evaluated under Rule 23(b)(3) when any monetary relief is at stake. Mr. Boutrous maintained that the "incidental damages" test is contrary to the plain language of Rule 23(b)(2). 

Practical considerations. Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor focused Mr. Sellers on the practical problems of certifying such a massive class. Justice Ginsburg questioned how a judge can possibly calculate back pay for hundreds of thousands of employees. Mr. Sellers answered that plaintiffs have developed a reliable formula based on Wal-Mart's database to evaluate monetary damages. Justice Sotomayor was skeptical of such a statistical model because such a model would prevent defendants from having an opportunity to defend themselves. In his rebuttal, Mr. Boutrous emphasized Justice Sotomayor's concern. He reiterated that the district court below had found that it would be "impossible" to hold individual hearings and that individual hearings are necessary to comport with due process requirements. Thus, Mr. Boutrous argued, a trial would inevitably violate Wal-Mart's constitutional rights.

While both Mr. Boutrous and Mr. Sellers faced tough questioning from the justices, Mr. Sellers failed to give the Court a satisfactory answer to the core question: What was Wal-Mart's uniform discriminatory policy applicable to every single store in the country that would make this case suitable for class-wide treatment? After all, it is only when there is sufficient "commonality" among the plaintiffs' claims that a class action is ever proper; otherwise, the action will devolve into a series of mini-trials to determine whether each individual plaintiff faced unlawful discrimination. The justices' questions emphasized the plaintiffs' logical quandary in simultaneously arguing that Wal-Mart managers had "no guidance whatsoever" but were influenced by "a very strong corporate culture." This line of questioning — coupled with the fact that the Court specifically asked the parties to address this question when it granted certiorari — suggests that a majority of the Court is deeply troubled with the Ninth Circuit's application of Rule 23(a).

Based on the oral argument, it seems likely the Supreme Court will modify the Ninth Circuit's decision in some way. Indeed, the questioning suggests that the Court may even be unanimous that the Ninth Circuit's decision went too far. Where the Supreme Court may fracture, however, is in articulating the correct rule to govern future class actions. Some Justices appear willing to fundamentally reformulate the test for Rule 23(a); others are likely to take a more incrementalist approach. It also remains to be seen whether the Court resolves the case on the basis of  Rule 23(a) or Rule 23(b)(2), or both. The Supreme Court will likely issue its decision by June 2011.

‘Not against’ investment by Kansai, Walmart

Trade and industry chief defends state’s stance on foreign investors

Industrial Correspondent

THE government’s activist stance in merger proceedings should not be construed as opposing foreign investment, says Department of Trade and Industry acting director-general Lionel October.

Interviewed by Business Day yesterday, Mr October sought to deflect criticism that the government’s opposition to two major foreign investments amounted to scaring off the badly needed investment the government insists SA needs to ramp up growth and to create jobs.

The department last week opposed a move by Japan’s Kansai Paint, made last April, to take over SA’s Freeworld Coatings.

It had asked the Competition Commission that the takeover be prohibited or that conditions be imposed on the sale that would ensure that public interest and competition concerns were met.

The department had also asked the Competition Tribunal to insist that US retail giant Walmart voluntarily agree to local sourcing as a matter of & public interest& Mr October said the department had intervened in the Walmart hearing in an attempt to expand the definition of public interest in the Competition Act.

Analysts have described the intervention as & potentially discriminating& and said it was a disincentive to investment.

The department’s 11th-hour submission last week to the Competition Commission on the Freeworld deal argues that a hostile takeover would be likely to weaken competition in an already concentrated market. It said the deal would prejudice SA’s industrial capacity and threaten local jobs and intellectual property.

It said the takeover was a direct threat to the state-backed localisation drive, especially in the strategic automotive sector, and that job losses would be an inevitable consequence of a curtailment or cessation of local manufacture.

Freeworld had made a significant contribution to uniquely South African product development in partnership with Stellenbosch University, the department told the commission.

& It is important to stress the department is motivated by these considerations and this intervention should not be construed as opposition … to foreign direct investment,& said Mr October.

& We wanted, in this case, to look at the merits of the matter. Remember they (Kansai) are not opening a new plant. They are taking over R& D (research and development). Foreign direct investment must assist the country in bringing in new technology. Kansai itself said it was not opposed to conditionalities.& Mr October said the Walmart intervention was mainly a supply-chain issue regarding Chinese imports ousting local manufacturers. & They (China) have such economies of scale that they can displace domestic suppliers. This has a systemic impact on the country,& he said.

Stephen Langbridge, head of law firm Bell Dewar’s competition department, said yesterday the recent intervention by the Department of Trade and Industry might & indicate a new activism& quot;This is so particularly in regard to the so-called ‘public interest’ elements of merger consideration. The interest of government is more related to policy, rather than pure competition concerns,& Mr Langbridge said.

& The Freeworld board’s apparent reluctance to proceed with the transaction does not appear to be strongly based on pure competition grounds.

& Perhaps, overall, this case demonstrates once again how competition matters are often used as a platform for strategic behaviour of opposing interested parties,& he said.

What sex has to do with succeeding at Wal-Mart; IS IT SURPRISING MOSTLY male management prefers mostly male management? Viewpoint

IF YOU WANT TO KNOW why so few women hold executive positions at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., here's the answer the Walton Institute gives out to management trainees:

Women aren't as aggressive at seeking promotions as men.

Not surprisingly, women at Wal-Mart have a different explanation: Management stereotypes employees by gender (see example above).

Women from Florida to Alaska swear in court papers that they wanted to build careers at Wal-Mart, worked extra hard, earned good evaluations and openly sought promotion only to be bypassed by less-qualified men.

So they filed the world's largest sex discrimination case against the world's largest employer. How's that for gumption?

Their case has been going well for them, if slowly, since they filed it 10 years ago. But when it got to the U.S. Supreme Court this week, they ran into trouble. How much trouble's hard to say until the court rules, probably in June.

Given the size of Wal-Mart's labor force, we are talking about a case that would cover at least 500,000 employees and possibly more than 1 million. Every current female employee can become part of the lawsuit that claims companywide bias against them, two federal courts in California have ruled.

The class is so humongous, and each woman's situation so different from another's, that Wal-Mart said the Supreme Court should disband it and force any aggrieved employee to sue individually. It's just too big for a court to manage fairly, they said.

And yet, the company's sheer size, with its gargantuan labor force, can't be allowed to insulate it from claims that something about its corporate conduct denied hundreds of thousands of employees the pay they would have gotten but for their sex.

"If the employer had 500 female employees, I doubt that any of my colleagues would question the certification of such a class," said 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Susan Graber, writing approvingly but separately from the 6–5 majority that let the class certification stand last year.

Wal-Mart said company-wide policy forbids discrimination, not encourages it. For a class-action lawsuit to prevail, the women have to show corporate involvement. But at Wal-Mart, each manager in its 3,400 stores has near-complete freedom to decide pay and promotions.

So we're talking about a huge coincidence, apparently. Women in almost every job category, in each of Wal-Mart's 41 regions, make less than men in the same jobs, by an average of $5,000, according to the plaintiffs' statistician. This is true despite findings that women stay with the company longer than men and generally have higher performance ratings.

Deli manager

Gretchen Adams said she was told she was getting top pay at $26,500, when promoted to deli manager at a Walmart Supercenter in Stillwater, Okla. Then she found out that a man she was training for the same position in Jasper, Ala., was getting $30,000. It happened again when she trained a man in Cape Coral, Fla., and then in Las Vegas.

Although similar accusations show up in multiple stores located around the country, Wal-Mart's statistician challenged the plaintiffs' figures as being too regional to be useful. Looking on a store-by-store, department-bydepartment basis, she found little pay disparity, a method the plaintiffs attack.

As for promotions, the company doesn't post most openings. You learn about them if your manager taps you on the shoulder and suggests you apply. Is it surprising that the mostly male management prefers mostly male management, especially in a corporate culture as traditional as Wal-Mart's?

Through classes, meetings and pep rallies at stores, the company's Bentonville, Ark., home office sends forth its culture to each and every store.

Scalia's confusion

So while the plaintiffs acknowledge decentralized personnel decisions at Wal-Mart, they said that the company's distinctive and tightly controlled corporate culture plays an indirect but powerful role.

"I'm getting whipsawed here" as to how personnel decisions are made, Justice Antonin Scalia complained to the lawyer for the women.

"On the one hand, you say the problem is that they were utterly subjective, and on the other hand, you say there is strong corporate culture that guides all of this.

"Well, which is it?" Scalia demanded.

Does he really not understand this?

Just maybe

It could be both. You just might have a corporate culture that allows illegal job discrimination to flourish at the hands of independent store managers. It could happen if management trainers defend the paucity of women in higher ranks and tells trainees women don't want promotions; if the company sponsors hunting trips as bonding exercises for executives; if the home office doesn't intervene when its mostly male store management keeps promoting mostly men or ask questions when men are routinely paid more than better-qualified women doing the same work.

For all the discussion of whether a company-wide policy or practice keeps women down, it's too early in the case to say for sure. A trial will determine that.

But there's enough for the Supreme Court to allow the class action suit to keep going.

Regarding the March 30 editorial "A rollback at Wal-Mart":

It is disappointing that The Post's editors appear to accept Wal-Mart's argument regarding the huge sex-discrimination lawsuit against the retailer, that its failure to monitor its agents allows it to evade responsibility for the abuses of those agents.

Whether there is a cohesive legal class for such a lawsuit may be a legitimate issue, but whether Wal-Mart is responsible for its managers' actions in the normal execution of their official duties is not. "Choosing not to know" is no more a legitimate excuse for misconduct than "I was just following orders."

Top Court Hears Wal-Mart Case

WASHINGTON — Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court — hearing arguments last week involving the sex-discrimination lawsuit against Wal-Mart Stores — questioned whether the class-action suit should go forward.

The suit, filed in 2001 on behalf of current and former female workers who currently number almost 3 million, alleges that Wal-Mart systematically paid women less than men and provided fewer opportunities for promotion. The court is expected to issue a decision by summer.

The Associated Press quoted Justice Anthony Kennedy as saying he is unsure “what the unlawful policy is” that Wal-Mart engaged in, and Justice Antonin Scalia said he felt “whipsawed” by the issue, asking, “Which is it? Either individual managers are on their own [in making decisions] or else a strong corporate culture tells them what to do.”

Joseph Sellers, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, said lower courts that ruled in favor of the discrimination lawsuit going forward were persuaded by statistical and other evidence that a strong corporate culture at Wal-Mart stereotyped women as less aggressive than men, which translated into lower pay and fewer promotions.

Lawyers look for profits in Walmart case

There is a case before the Supreme Court now that, if decided on behalf of the plaintiffs, would make some lawyers very, very wealthy, even though it would damage consumers, workers and one of the best companies in America while violating principles of fair play and sound law. But what the heck? That's the American way, right?

Yes, of course it is, at least if you look at much of what's been happening in our courts over the years, with average Americans out a pile of money owing to outcomes that in many instances are questionable, to say the least.

But please, please, kind justices, just say no this time out, telling the lawyers that they will not be allowed to pursue a class-action, self-enriching bamboozlement in which Walmart could be forced to pay something like a million and a half women recompense based on the claims of seven people.

The case goes like this. The seven women, who have gotten the nod to proceed in lower courts, say they were not treated equally with men in promotions and pay, and the lawyers say the same is true of every woman who has worked for Walmart since 1998.

They would like to sue on behalf of the whole crowd, potentially getting payments for one and all and a percentage of the haul for themselves, on the ground that research shows women don't fare as well as men at the fabled retail firm. They agree there was no companywide rule dictating anything nasty at the 3,400 outlets, but say loose controls and a culture of male privilege amount to the same thing.

Observers cite a number of problems. Justice is only justice when defendants can answer specific accusations with evidence of their own. In this suit, many women who faced no workplace impediments would be on the victims' list. The store has stats refuting the drift of plaintiff stats and it has anti-discriminatory policies, to boot.

What's more, it's said, if this suit is allowed to go forward, it will mean other big companies in America can be similarly sued via class action ― and they all will be, leading to settlements to avoid the possibility of runaway, wholly ruinous jury verdicts. The billions from Walmart would be just step one down the golden road.

Walmart would be a good place to start because it is so hated, or is it? By the left, yes, but not by the 100 million who shop in the outlets every week, mostly folks of limited means who thereby save what's been estimated at $100 billion a year, an extraordinary living-standard boon they appreciate even if it makes the hoity-toity yawn.

The nation's largest private employer, the company also hires 1.4 million people who are often supplementing family incomes and sometimes living in situations in which extra benefits come from spouses or parents, according to one commentary. While they aren't going to get rich at this work even as they advance, an analyst for the Cato think tank points out that if they could do better elsewhere, they would obviously go elsewhere.

If the Supreme Court says yes to the class action, and the lawyers get a major settlement, Walmart would survive, but the company would likely have to retreat, maybe reducing outlets and workers, making life worse for both men and women employees while making life less bargain-happy for low-income Americans. The only ones coming out ahead would be the lawyers, who, in addition to such civil law suits, have brought tort actions that cost the average consumer something equal to an extra 10 percent tax on wages, according to the Pacific Research Institute.

I know some of those suits are justified and reasonable, but many aren't, and I can't help wishing these lawyers could get a taste of their own medicine and face the chance of a devastating class action suit themselves.

Alas, it's just a dream.

Protests & Pileups; Last week at the Court: from Wal-Mart to Scalia's lead foot. WASHINGTON

Last week's U.S. Supreme Court sessions were dominated by headline-making oral arguments and decisions.

Following are dispatches from the Court about those and other developments, drawn and condensed from NLJ's newsletter Supreme Court Insider.

The massive class action against retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ran into stiff resistance at the Supreme Court on March 29, after surviving lower court challenges ever since it was launched 10 years ago.

"It's not clear to me: What is the unlawful policy that Wal-Mart has adopted?" said Justice Anthony Kennedy, who as usual is the likely swing vote in the closely watched business case Wal-Mart v. Dukes. The outcome of the dispute, involving as many as 3 million female current and former workers, could cost Wal-Mart billions in back pay or limit the use of class actions as a civil rights remedy.

Picking up on a point made by Wal-Mart, Kennedy told the lawyer for the plaintiffs that his argument "faces in two directions." Plaintiffs claim that gender discrimination at Wal-Mart resulted from excess discretion given to local store managers on the one hand, and a companywide "corporate culture" that led to biased decisions on the other hand.

"I'm getting whipsawed here," said Justice Antonin Scalia, following up on Kennedy's concern. "Which is it?"

Joseph Sellers, name partner at Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll in Washington, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said that while managers are given "broad discretion," they "do not make these decisions in a vacuum." The justices did not seem satisfied with his answer.

The issue before the Court is a threshold one: whether women employees at Wal-Mart had enough in common to certify a class under federal rules of civil procedure governing class actions, and whether such a class could, if successful, win back-pay damages or merely an injunction against future discrimination.

Outside the Court, a group of noisy demonstrators protested against Wal-Mart, while inside, the courtroom was packed with spectators. Among them was Eugene Scalia, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and son of Scalia the justice. Wal-Mart critics urged the justice to recuse because a Gibson Dunn partner of his son's, Theodore Boutrous Jr., was arguing for Wal-Mart, and Eugene Scalia has represented Wal-Mart in the past.

Instead of making broad statements about the potential harm to Wal-Mart if the class action is upheld, Boutrous stuck to the details of class action requirements. He attacked the statistical and sociological evidence the plaintiffs presented to win creation of the class as insufficient to meet the requirements of commonality. And he defended the company as one with a clear policy and track record favoring the hiring of women.

Boutrous stopped short of saying that class actions are never appropriate for attacking discrimination.

"It does not seem that the Court is interested in throwing out class actions," said plaintiffs' lawyer John Mahoney, a Washington partner at Tully Rinckey. "That's hopefully good news for plaintiffs but not necessarily the plaintiffs in this case."

In upholding the class certification, an en banc panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit found that the class could seek back pay even though Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes injunctive and declaratory relief.

After the argument, Proskauer Rose special employment counsel Amanda Haverstick, who was in attendance, said enough justices expressed concerns about the fairness of back-pay penalties that "it is possible the Court will affirm the class but take the back-pay aspect out of it."

SCALIA'S BAD DAY

Justice Scalia seemed unusually subdued at the beginning of the Wal-Mart arguments, waiting until the second halfhour to ask his first question of the day. He is usually dominating the discussion well before that point.

A possible explanation has emerged: He had been in a car accident in Virginia a little more than an hour earlier while driving in to work. News accounts called it minor, but it must have been unsettling; it involved four cars, and Scalia's own car was towed away, according to The Washington Post.

Scalia was given a ticket for following too closely behind the car in front of him. When that car stopped, Scalia rear-ended it, pushing it ahead into a chain-reaction crash that dinged the two cars ahead of it.

At the Court, few were surprised to hear about the episode. Scalia, who turned 75 on March 11, has a reputation for having a lead foot. Former Justice David Souter even joked during an oral argument about Scalia's fast driving.

It was in the case of Maryland v. Wilson, argued on Dec. 11, 1996. The case involved the arrest of a passenger in a car that had been stopped by police. Souter wanted to explore whether a passenger in these circumstances was free to leave. He posited a hypothetical in which a passenger would want to leave the car, and Scalia added the fact that the passenger was disgusted with the driver's speeding.

"You can see what Justice Scalia's passengers tend to feel like," Souter said with a smile.

CAMPAIGN FINANCE

A key feature of Arizona's publicfinancing system for elections appeared to be in serious constitutional trouble on March 28 at the Court.

The justices heard spirited arguments in two consolidated cases challenging the matching-funds trigger in the Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Act. By the end of the hourlong session, the same justices who prevailed in last year's blockbuster Citizens United v. FEC, striking down a major federal restriction on corporate spending, had voiced strong skepticism about the Arizona provision.

"Do you think it would be a fair characterization of this law to say that its purpose and its effect are to produce less speech in political campaigns?" Kennedy asked.

Representing the law's challengers, William Maurer of the Institute for Justice, said yes, adding, "The entire motivation of this law was to limit spending in leveling the playing field. Limiting spending indicates that they wanted less political speech in the state of Arizona, and that's what they've got."

The two First Amendment challenges are Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett and McComish v. Bennett. The matching-funds provision was upheld by the 9th Circuit.

During the arguments, Maurer and his opponents—Bradley Phillips of Los Angeles' Munger, Tolles & Olson, and Assistant to the Solicitor General William Jay—offered dramatically different views of the impact of the matchingfunds provision on campaign speech.

Maurer, representing the Freedom Club PAC, told the justices that the provision chills campaign speech by privately financed candidates and groups making independent expenditures. It forces them to refrain from raising or spending campaign-related funds so as not to trigger matching funds to their publicly financed opponents, he argued. "The government provides a direct subsidy [to the publicly financed candidate] based on my act of speaking."

Phillips, defending the system, countered that the provision actually increases campaign speech and spending. It allows the publicly funded candidate, he said, to spend nearly as much as the privately financed candidate (up to three times the initial grant of public money). "Statistical evidence shows that independent expenditures have gone up since the law was enacted."

The law was the result of a 1998 voter referendum after one of the worst election-related scandals in the state's history.

Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg pressed Maurer repeatedly on why the matchingfunds provision burdened speech in violation of the First Amendment. "There's no restriction at all here," a particularly skeptical Kagan said. "It's more speech all around."

Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. noted that the state commission, which administers the public financing system, states on its Web site that the system equalizes the playing field—a purpose that the Supreme Court has held is impermissible under the First Amendment. "Why isn't that clear evidence that it's unconstitutional?"

At one point, a clearly frustrated Justice Stephen Breyer interjected, "What's going through my mind is we are deeply into the details of a very complex bill. McCain-Feingold [the federal bipartisan campaign reform law of 2002] is hundreds of pages, and we can't possibly test each provision....And is it better to say it is all illegal than to subject these things to death by a thousand cuts?"

After the arguments, Douglas Kendall, head of the Constitutional Accountability Center, which supports the state law, said in a statement, "Today, the same bloc of five justices who struck down big parts of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law last year in Citizens United appeared inclined to similarly gut an effort by Arizona to expand speech."

If you want to know why so few women hold executive positions at Walmart, here's the answer the Walton Institute gives out to management trainees: women aren't as aggressive at seeking promotions as men.

Not surprisingly, women at Walmart have a different explanation: management stereotypes employees by gender.

Women from Florida to Alaska swear in court papers that they wanted to build careers at Walmart, worked extra hard, earned good evaluations and openly sought promotion only to be bypassed by less-qualified men. So they filed the world's largest sex discrimination case against the world's largest employer.

Their case has been going well for them, if slowly, since they filed it 10 years ago. But when it got to the US Supreme Court last week, they ran into trouble. How much trouble is hard to say until the court rules, probably in June.

Given the size of Walmart's labour force, the case would cover at least 500 000 employees and possibly more than 1 million. Every current female employee can become part of the lawsuit that claims company-wide bias against them, two federal courts in California have ruled.

The class is so huge, and each woman's situation so different from another's, that Walmart says the Supreme Court should disband it and force any aggrieved employee to sue individually.

And yet, the company's sheer size can't be allowed to insulate it from claims that its corporate conduct denied hundreds of thousands of employees the pay they would have gotten but for their sex.

Walmart says company-wide policy forbids discrimination, not encourages it. For a class action lawsuit to prevail, corporate involvement must be shown. But at Walmart, each store manager has near-complete freedom on pay and promotions.

So we're talking about a huge coincidence, apparently.

Women in almost every job category make less than men in the same jobs, by an average of $5 000 (R33 250), according to the plaintiffs' statistician. This is despite findings that women stay with the company longer than men and generally have higher performance ratings.

Gretchen Adams says she was told she was getting top pay at $26 500, when promoted to deli manager at a Walmart Supercenter in Oklahoma. Then she found out that a man she was training for the same position in Alabama was getting $30 000. It happened again when she trained a man in Florida, and then in Las Vegas.

Although similar accusations show up in stores around the country, Walmart's statistician challenged the plaintiffs' figures as being too regional to be useful. On a department-by-department, store-by-store basis, she found little pay disparity.

As for promotions, the company does not post most openings. You learn about them if your manager taps you on the shoulder and suggests you apply.

Through classes, meetings and pep rallies at stores, the company's home office sends forth its culture to every store.

So while the plaintiffs acknowledge decentralised personnel decisions at Walmart, they say the company's distinctive and tightly controlled corporate culture plays an indirect but powerful role.

For all the discussion of whether a company-wide policy or practice keeps women down, it's too early in the case to say for sure. A trial will determine that. But there's enough for the Supreme Court to allow the class action suit to keep going.

Wal-Mart may or may not have a policy of discriminating against women in pay and promotion, but establishing the truth will require a trial. The US Supreme Court last week wrestled with whether it should clear the way for a class-action lawsuit brought by a handful of women on behalf of as many as 1.5 million others. The case for doing so is strong.

The plaintiffs say Wal-Mart is "rife with gender stereotypes demeaning to female employees" and link that to lower pay and the fact that "while women comprise over 80 percent of hourly supervisors, they hold only one third of store management jobs". They note that a lower court found their statistical analysis of the retailer's decisions raised "an inference of company-wide discrimination".

Class-action suits are controversial, but provide justice for workers who can't afford to proceed with anti-discrimination suits individually and provide an efficient way for the judicial system to deal with far-flung claims. But whether such suits can go forward depends on a court's determination that there are questions of fact and law common to members of the proposed class. Wal-Mart scoffs at the notion that all of its female employees could constitute a class, given differences in location, job description and experience. But a pervasive policy of gender discrimination is an adequate common denominator.

In arguing that Wal-Mart had a policy of treating male employees better than female ones, the plaintiffs make essentially two arguments: that Wal-Mart radiated a corporate culture of gender bias and that the retailer's headquarters gave too much discretion to local managers.

If the Supreme Court rules that the plaintiffs constitute a legitimate class, they will still have to substantiate their allegations at trial (or negotiate a settlement with Wal-Mart). The only question for the court at this point is whether Wal-Mart's female employees can avail themselves of a form of lawsuit capacious enough to cover all of those who might have been the subjects of discrimination. The fair answer is yes. - The Los Angeles Times

In a video by USA Today, Wal-Mart U.S. CEO Bill Simon said inflation was "going to be serious" as cost increases begin showing up in the retailer's product chain.

In an interview with the national newspaper's editorial board, Simon also commented on the sex discrimination lawsuit Wal-Mart faces and its appearance at the U.S. Supreme Court. He also noted Wal-Mart's work supporting Michelle Obama's health food initiative.

As for inflation, Simon said the retailer had already seen price increases among dairy and cotton productions and that more increases were coming in transportation-related products like paper. He said inflation could start to affect the retailer later in the year.

"No retailer is going to be able to wish this new cost reality away," Simon told the newspaper. "They're not going to be able to insulate the consumer 100 percent."

Supreme Court expected to overturn Wal-Mart ruling

The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to overturn the appeals court ruling that approved a massive class action lawsuit alleging gender discrimination by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., many experts said after last week’s hearing on the issue.

But how it will do so is unclear, observers said. The court could dismiss the case altogether or approve creation of a smaller class or classes.

Many observers anticipate the court’s decision, which is expected in June, will be narrowly focused and provide little guidance in litigating future class actions.

“It’s always difficult to get a precise read on how their ruling will come down,” said Mary-Christine Sungaila, an attorney with Snell & Wilmer L.L.P. in Costa Mesa, Calif., whose firm submitted an amicus brief in the case on behalf of the Chicago-based International Assn. of Defense Counsel in support of Wal-Mart.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. vs. Betty Dukes et al., originally filed in 2001, involves allegations that Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart promoted and paid female employees less than males in comparable positions despite females’ higher performance ratings and seniority. The suit, which seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, lost pay and punitive damages, could involve up to 1.5 million people and cost Wal-Mart billions if successful.

In 2007, a divided three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld a lower court’s 2004 ruling that granted class action status to women who work or have worked at Wal-Mart’s 3,400 stores since 1998.

In its April 2010 decision, the en banc 9th Circuit ruled 6-5 to uphold most aspects of the district court’s ruling in a technical opinion. It concluded that the proposed plaintiffs in the case had enough in common to create a class despite their varying jobs and worksites.

The Supreme Court is considering two questions in the case, both of which relate to federal rules of civil procedure as to when class actions can be formed and technical issues as to when members of a proposed class have enough in common.

The high court is focusing on procedural issues and not directly considering the merits of the plaintiffs’ charges, observers say.

“If the court rules for Wal-Mart, no plaintiff goes away,” said John R. Wester, an attorney with Robinson Bradshaw & Hinson P.A. in Charlotte, N.C., who is not involved in the case. “Each plaintiff’s case is as viable as it ever was.”

Observers generally expect the 9th Circuit’s decision to be overturned.

Gerald L. Maatman Jr., a partner with law firm Seyfarth Shaw L.L.P. in Chicago, said the justices’ questions “tended to be very aggressive and very averse to the theoretical underpinnings of the plaintiffs’ case.”

Mr. Maatman’s firm submitted an amicus brief in the case supporting Wal-Mart on behalf of the Alexandria, Va.-based Society for Human Resource Management and the Washington-based HR Policy Assn. and another brief on behalf of Issaquah, Wash.-based Costco Wholesale Corp.

Observers said one factor arguing in favor of a Wal-Mart win was some justices’ apparent discomfort about the plaintiffs’ contentions that while managers have discretion in making personnel decisions, there also is a strong corporate culture that supported gender discrimination.

For instance, Justice Antonin Scalia said at one point, “I’m getting whipsawed here…Well, which is it? It’s either the individual supervisors are left on their own, or else there is a strong corporate culture that tells them what to do.”

“There appears to be a consensus of at least five justices that the class does not satisfy even the minimum threshold requirements for any class action under the federal rule,” said Felix Shafir, an attorney with Horvitz & Levy L.L.P. in Encino, Calif., who was not involved in the case.

Jonathan F. Cohn, a partner with Sidley Austin L.L.P. in Washington, whose firm submitted an amicus brief on behalf of Chicago-based DRI-the Voice of the Defense Bar, said the justices also seemed troubled by how to determine back pay and injunctive relief. “There isn’t going to be the opportunity to really drill down and see the merits of each claim,” he said.

Mark W. Batten, a partner with Proskauer Rose L.L.P. in Boston, who was not involved in the case, said Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan seemed to suggest that one solution would be to take “the money out of the case so that what was left was a claim for injunctive relief.”

Many observers anticipate a narrowly worded opinion.

“They seemed to be harping upon the specific circumstances of this cases,” which suggests their opinion may be narrow and the court will not “issue a broad ruling that’s going to affect every class action out there,” Mr. Cohn said.

“I don’t see them giving any broad guidance,” said Paul E. Starkman, a partner with Arnstein & Lehr L.L.P. in Chicago, who is not involved in the case. “They really try to decide on the most narrow grounds possible.”

The high court will not necessarily dismiss the case, some observers say.

“I think they will vacate the 9th Circuit’s en banc ruling and send it back to the trial court to evaluate whether some smaller kind of class action can proceed,” said Mr. Wester.

The case could be divided into classes by region or even by store, Mr. Starkman said.

“The plaintiffs haven’t asked for a smaller class action,” although “no matter how the court rules, there’s always the possibility of bringing a more manageable class action,” said Richard Samp, chief counsel of the Washington Legal Foundation, which submitted an amicus brief in support of Wal-Mart.

Wal-Mart: Where even small numbers are big numbers

Like seemingly everything associated with Wal-Mart, the behemoth retailer that is being sued for discrimination by female employees, the case is big. Very big. Whether in terms of numbers (more than 1 million women could become plaintiffs if the Supreme Court allows the case to move forward), potential settlements (Wal-Mart could be on the hook for more than $1 billion) or possible consequences (however the case is decided, it's likely to have wide-ranging implications on job bias suits in the future), the Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores decision is tremendous.

As a result, even the numbers the retailer is using to defend its case are extraordinary. Its attorneys have said that choosing whether to grant class-action status (the decision before the Supreme Court is just that - not whether Wal-Martdiscriminated) should be based on more than "statistics, sociology and anecdotes." Some 90 percent of its 3,400 stores at the time of a lower court's decision, Wal-Mart has said, do not have statistically significant differences in male and female employee pay.

That infers, however, that pay differences do or could exist at 10 percent of its stores. That might be a small ratio, but at Wal-Mart, even small percentages yield eye-popping numbers. Ten percent of the women in question is still potentially 100,000 people.

Even so, Wal-Mart seems more focused on fighting the class-action status than the impression that there is any discrimination going on at its stores. While the company has said that the anecdotes, such as meetings held at a Hooters restaurant or an employee being told she didn't get the same raise as her male colleague because he had a family to support, do not reflect company policies, it has also blamed any differences on decisions made at the local level.

The company may be wise to fight the first battle first, trying to avoid the class action and defend its practices at the corporate level. The numbers at stake are just that big. As are the consequences: More than 20 other major corporations have filed briefs in support of Wal-Mart and out of fear that a decision in favor of the plaintiffs could open the floodgates for similar class actions.

What gender has to do with getting ahead at Wal-Mart

NEW YORK: If you want to know why so few women hold executive positions at Wal-Mart Stores, here's the answer the Walton Institute gives out to management trainees:

Women aren't as aggressive at seeking promotions as men.

Not surprisingly, women at Wal-Mart have a different explanation: Management stereotypes employees by gender (see example above).

Women from Florida to Alaska swear in court papers that they wanted to build careers at Wal-Mart, worked extra hard, earned good evaluations and openly sought promotion only to be bypassed by less-qualified men. So they filed the world's largest sex discrimination case against the world's largest employer. How's that for gumption

Their case has been going well for them, if slowly, since they filed it 10 years ago. But when it got to the US Supreme Court this week, they ran into trouble. How much trouble's hard to say until the court rules, probably in June.

Given the size of Wal-Mart's labour force, we are talking about a case that would cover at least 500,000 employees and possibly more than one million. Every current female employee can become part of the lawsuit that claims company-wide bias against them, two federal courts in California have ruled.

The class is so humongous, and each woman's situation so different from another's, that Wal-Mart says the Supreme Court should disband it and force any aggrieved employee to sue individually. It's just too big for a court to manage fairly, they say.

And yet, the company's sheer size, with its gargantuan labour force, can't be allowed to insulate it from claims that something about its corporate conduct denied hundreds of thousands of employees the pay they would have gotten but for their sex.

"If the employer had 500 female employees, I doubt that any of my colleagues would question the certification of such a class," 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Susan Graber, writing approvingly but separately from the 6-5 majority that let the class certification stand last year.

Wal-Mart says company-wide policy forbids discrimination, not encourages it. For a class-action lawsuit to prevail, the women have to show corporate involvement. But at Wal-Mart, each manager in its 3,400 stores has near-complete freedom to decide pay and promotions.

So we're talking about a huge coincidence, apparently. Women in almost every job category, in each of Wal-Mart's 41 regions make less than men in the same jobs, by an average of $5,000, according to the plaintiffs' statistician. This is true despite findings that women stay with the company longer than men and generally have higher performance ratings.

Gretchen Adams says she was told she was getting top pay at $26,500, when promoted to deli manager at a Wal-Mart Supercenter in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Then she found out that a man she was training for the same position in Jasper, Alabama, was getting $30,000. It happened again when she trained a man in Cape Coral, Florida, and then in Las Vegas.

Although similar accusations show up in multiple stores located around the country, Wal-Mart's statistician challenged the plaintiffs' figures as being too regional to be useful. Looking on a store-by-store, department-by-department basis, she found little pay disparity, a method the plaintiffs attack.

As for promotions, the company doesn't post most openings. You learn about them if your manager taps you on the shoulder and suggests you apply. Is it surprising that the mostly male management prefers mostly male management, especially in a corporate culture as traditional as Wal-Mart's

Through classes, meetings and pep rallies at stores, the company's Bentonville, Arkansas, home office sends forth its culture to each and every store.

So while the plaintiffs acknowledge decentralised personnel decisions at Wal-Mart, they say that the company's distinctive and tightly controlled corporate culture plays an indirect but powerful role. But there's enough for the Supreme Court to allow the class action suit to keep going.

 DISCRIMINATION  LAWYER NEVER LACKS FOR WORK

When he started handling employment-discrimination cases more than 30 years ago, attorney Bruce Atkins worried that he was developing a specialty that one day could become obsolete. Once companies learned they could be penalized for discriminating on the basis of gender, age or race, surely they would stop doing it, he thought. Now, he says, he doesn't worry about employment cases drying up. "I think it's almost impossible to eradicate totally," said Atkins, founding partner of Deutsch Atkins in Hackensack. "Corporations are made up of people," he said, and "people have built-in biases."

Atkins, 59, of Woodcliff Lake, won a record $6.5 million judgment in 1996 for a female commercial real estate broker who was denied commissions and fired after hitting the so-called glass ceiling after years in the industry. He spoke with The Record on the day the Supreme Court began hearing oral arguments in what could become the most important employment class-action case in history -- the lawsuit accusing Wal-Mart Stores Inc. of discriminating against its female employees. (Interview condensed for space.)

Q. The Wal-Mart discrimination case went before the Supreme Court last week. Are employment litigators watching it avidly? Is it like the Super Bowl for you?

Yes and no. We don't do a large amount of class actions, so it affects us less than firms that specialize in large class actions. We have been involved in some class actions over the years. We were recently involved with one against Home Depot. That class got decertified on the same theory that's in front of the Supreme Court with Wal-Mart -- that there were too many diversified employees doing different things.

Q. If Supreme Court decertifies the Wal-Mart class action, will it be a death blow for class actions?

If they decertify it, it depends on how they decertify it. If they do a very broad-brush type of opinion, yes. It depends on how they parse it. The wording in Supreme Court decisions becomes all important. They could say "in this particular case, with this particular set of facts, with this particular diverse group," and limit the effect of the opinion. Or they could just say "when you have this many people in this many locations, you can't have a class action." That would be more general in nature. The big issue in that case is the issue of individuals, who may have, as part of a larger group, been discriminated as a class, and who can't afford to bring an individual suit.

Q. Do you mostly handle employment cases involving executives?

The emphasis of the practice is on executive level, but we don't only handle executive-level cases. We've represented receptionists who have had sexual-harassment actions. We've handled laborers with wage-and-hour claims.

Q. For those types of cases, do you get paid after the case is resolved? Could a receptionist afford to pay upfront?

We have a number of different fee arrangements. It's rare we do a pure contingency. We usually do a modified form of contingency where the client has to put some money up. These are very expensive litigations to run. They're very labor-intensive. Consequently, in order to be able to function from a business model we need some seed money to pay the staff, to pay the rent, to keep the lights on.

Q. When was the heyday of discrimination cases?

It's still the heyday. I say it all the time. Corporate stupidity keeps me in business.

Q. Have the early discrimination lawsuits changed corporate culture?

They have changed it in a lot of companies, but not all. Let's face it -- human are humans, and there are people who still carry their own personal biases, and some of those people get into positions of making decisions. You can never totally eradicate it; there's always going to be someone who does something silly somewhere.

Q. Are you seeing new kinds of employment suits? Cyberbullying in the workplace?

On bullying, equal opportunity abusers are still legal. If an abusive boss is abusive to everybody, it's still legal. It's only if you pick on somebody based upon their characteristics that it is illegal. It's the discrimination that's illegal. Not the bullying.

What has become popular now are the wage-and-hour actions, where you claim somebody's an exempt employee and shouldn't be paid overtime, and it turns out under the rules they should be paid overtime. Other growing areas are disability discrimination and family leave act violations, both federal and state.

Q. What should an employee do to document a discrimination claim?

I always tell people e-mail works both ways. You don't need an e- mail from the supervisor who just spoke to you. You can confirm your conversation with the supervisor by e-mail. If you have a conversation with your supervisor and your supervisor says, "You lazy bitch. Get your ass back to your desk or I'm going to fire you," you can write "Thank you for calling me a lazy bitch." It's amazing to me how employees don't realize they can do that. But we don't often get the luxury of advising people while they're still employed. They come to us afterward.

Q. Who's your dream juror in an employment case?

What you want to see are good family people, people who work, people who care about working and family, because they will understand how devastating it can be when work is taken away. There is a real human effect to losing a job. It's not just economics.

AMERICA:The women employees are taking on Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, over pay discrimination and American opinion is divided, writes LARA MARLOWE

MEMBERS OF the public started queuing before midnight in the hope of obtaining a seat in the red velvet and marble chamber of the Supreme Court. As the session opened in the morning, demonstrators on the steps outside chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho. Unfair pay has got to go.”

The case of Wal-Mart v. Dukes number 10-277, which was heard on March 29th, is the biggest employment discrimination suit ever to reach the Supreme Court, involving America’s largest private employer, who is also the world’s largest retailer.

A lower court which found in favour of Wal-Mart’s women employees estimated the number of defendants in the class action suit at 500,000. Wal-Mart says it has employed some 1.5 million women, all of whom might claim damages, since 1998.

Nine judges have until late June to hand down their decision. If they find in favour of Wal-Mart, the ability of “little people” to band together in class action suits will be seriously impaired.

The battle lines between the downtrodden and corporate America are clearly drawn.

The National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, the National Women’s Law Center and the National Employment Lawyers Association have sided with the women.

The US Chamber of Commerce and corporations including Costco, Intel, Del Monte Foods and General Electric, lined up behind Wal-Mart.

The plaintiffs’ lawyer Joseph Sellers argued that Wal-Mart managers used “unchecked discretion . . . to pay women less than men who were doing the same work in the same facilities at the same time, even though those women had more seniority and higher performance.”

The plaintiffs submitted 120 affidavits from women claiming they suffered gender discrimination.

When the suit was filed 10 years ago, 80 per cent of Wal-Mart employees were women, but two-thirds of its management were men. Women were paid on average $1.16 less an hour than men.

Plaintiffs say they were not told about training opportunities and jobs were filled without being advertised. A male colleague was given a large raise “because he had a family to support,” while a divorcee raising two children alone received an admonition from her boss to “doll up”.

The Supreme Court will rule only on the question of whether Wal-Mart’s female employees are too large and disparate a group to belong to a single class for the purpose of the law suit, but deliberations veered often into the substance of the case.

Vice president for human resources Gisel Ruiz testified that Wal-Mart “had strong policies against discrimination . . . long before the lawsuit was filed” and “there are consequences for people who violate those policies”.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who made her earlier career in employment law, was sceptical.

“If a company gets reports month after month showing that women are disproportionately passed over for promotion, and there’s a pay gap between men and women doing the same job, isn’t there some responsibility on the company to say is gender discrimination at work, and to stop it?”

Justice Ginsburg compared the Wal-Mart case to a 1970s ruling against ATT which found that men hired men “because all other things being equal, decision- makers tend to prefer people like themselves”.

Four Supreme Court judges are considered liberal, the other four conservative, with Justice Anthony Kennedy often providing the swing vote.

In assessing this week’s debate, observers added gender as a factor, with the three women judges showing more sympathy to the plaintiffs.

Justice Stephen Breyer was the only man who appeared to side with the women. Two women judges nonetheless expressed reservations about the means of determining back pay, which would amount to $1,100 for each woman, or well over $1 billion to be paid by Wal-Mart.

Under Chief Justice John Roberts, the court has gained a reputation for being pro-business and most experts predict a victory for Wal-Mart. Justice Roberts suggested that isolated cases of gender discrimination might be the result of “some bad apples” in the retailer’s 3,400 stores.

Justice Kennedy and Justice Antonin Scalia argued that there was a contradiction in the plaintiffs’ assertion that Wal-Mart fostered and strengthened a sexist corporate culture by giving local managers total discretion over hiring and promotion.

If the women win, the New York Daily Newswarned, “every woman in America can band together into a class to sue every employer in America. No joke.”

One of the more dubious arguments on behalf of Wal-Mart was that when it comes to equal pay and promotion for women, most US companies are in the same boat. “Every company in America could soon be a target,” moaned the Wall Street Journal.

The everybody-does-it argument sounds feeble to me, but it seemed to hold weight with the judges.

If you based discrimination cases on statistical evidence of pay and promotion, Justice Samuel Alito asked, wouldn’t that mean that “every single company” in the US was probably in violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act? Yes, probably, attorney Joseph Sellars replied for the plaintiffs.

Comment: Walmart - it's alive!: If the retailer is a person, as a US ruling contends, then perhaps it should exercise some self-control

What is Walmart - in a strictly taxonomic sense, that is? Based on size alone, it would be easy to confuse it with a nation: in 2002, its annual revenue was equal to or exceeded that of all but 22 nation-states. Or, if all its employees - 1.4 million in the US alone - were to gather in one place, you might think you were looking at a major city. But there is also the possibility that Walmart and other planet-spanning enterprises are not mere aggregations of people at all. They may be independent life forms - a species of super-organisms.

This seems to be the conclusion of the 2010 Citizens United decision, in which the US supreme court, in a frenzy of anthropomorphism, ruled that corporations are actually persons and therefore entitled to freedom of speech and the right to make unlimited campaign contributions. You may object that the notion of personhood had already been degraded beyond recognition by its extension, in the minds of pro-life thinkers, to individual cells such as zygotes. But the court must have reasoned that it would be discriminatory to let size enter into it: if a microscopic cell can be a person, then why not a brontosaurus, a tsunami or a multinational?

But Walmart's defence against a class action charging the company with discrimination against its female employees - Dukes v Walmart - throws a new light on the biology of large corporations. The company argues that with "seven divisions, 41 regions, 3,400 stores and over one million employees", the experiences of individual employees are just too variable to allow for a "class" in the legal sense to arise. Walmart, in other words, is too big, too multifaceted and too diverse to be sued.

So if Walmart is indeed a person, it is a person without a central nervous system, or at least without central control of its various body parts. There exist such persons, I admit, but surely, when the supreme court declared that corporations were persons, it did not mean to say "persons with advanced neuromuscular degenerative diseases".

For those who have never visited Walmart, let me point out that the company is not a congeries of boutiques run by egotistical divas. Every detail, from personnel policies to floor layout, is dictated by corporate HQ in Bentonville. An example: in 2000, I worked for three weeks in the womenswear department of a Walmart. In the course of my work, I made a number of suggestions to my supervisor - for example, that plus-size jeans not be displayed at practically floor-level, where plus-size women could not reach them without requiring assistance to regain altitude. Good idea, she said, but it was up to Bentonville to determine where the jeans resided.

Much has changed since my tenure at Walmart. The company has struggled to upgrade its sweatshop image. It has vowed to promote more women. But one thing it hasn't done is to reconfigure itself as an anarchist collective. Bentonville still rules absolutely, over both store managers and "associates", which is the winsome Walmart term for its chronically underpaid workers.

So if Walmart is a life form, it is an unclassifiable one. It eats, devouring town after town. It grows without limit, sometimes assuming new names - Walmex in Mexico, Asda in the UK. Yet in its defence in the Dukes v Walmart suit, Walmart claims to have no idea what it's doing. This could be a metaphor for capitalism or a sign that a successful alien invasion is in progress. The only thing that's for sure is, should the supreme court decide in favour of Walmart, we'll have a lot more of these creatures running around: monstrously oversized "persons" who insist that they can't control their own actions.

Bentonville

For those who have never visited Walmart, let me point out that the company is not a congeries of boutiques run by egotistical divas. Every detail, from personnel policies to floor layout, is dictated by corporate HQ in Bentonville. An example: in 2000, I worked for three weeks in the womenswear department of a Walmart.

Going After Wal-Mart

Law: If there was ever such a thing as junk justice, the suit against Wal-Mart now in the Supreme Court is exhibit A. By claiming that evidence is no longer needed to prove discrimination, what's proven is the greed of lawyers.

Tuesday was a queasy day at the Supreme Court as lawyers in the largest class-action lawsuit in history made the claim that Wal-Martdiscriminated against all 1.6 million of its female employees.

Nearly all the justices reportedly were unimpressed with the overreaching premise. It boils down to the idea that if six women could prove discrimination at one company — as happened in this case at 13 Wal-Mart stores — then, heck, 1.6 million other women who work for the same company should be included, too.

It's nothing but a bid to multiply a few instances of possible sex discrimination into a multibillion-dollar payout that will leave everyone else a loser.

Not since the Amazon Defense Front brought its spurious $100 billion lawsuit against Chevron in Ecuador has a flimsier case with higher stakes been brought before a high court. In Wal-Mart's case, as in Chevron's, it has been going on for at least a decade, as one judge after another bought into the absurd idea that discrimination can be proven just by statistics.

In Wal-Mart's case, 80% of its retail workforce is female, while only 33% of managers are. That said, it has had anti-discriminatory policies in place for decades.

According to the complaint: "Wal-Mart fosters or facilitates gender-stereotyping and discrimination ... and that this discrimination is common to all women who work or have worked in Wal-Mart stores."

The problem with this accusation is that justice is premised on individual rights. It requires an accuser, a right to confront the accused, the presentation of evidence and exculpatory evidence, and the weighing of that for an outcome.

The lawyers in this Wal-Mart case have gone from claiming six women were paid less than men and denied promotions to now claiming that if there are more male managers than female ones among any of the 2.1 million employees at Wal-Mart's 9,000 outlets worldwide, the only possible reason is discrimination.

It's a charge that would leave any company defenseless to answer, but particularly a big one, because the size of the overreaching claim makes examination of individual cases impossible.

This amounts to a one-size-fits-all logic that is utterly inimical to a free society and individual rights.

For this case to have any merit, women would have to be all alike, sporting identical talents, and every one of them interested in being a store manager. The lawsuit going forward insists on this premise, which ultimately reduces women to units.

All of a sudden, there's no such thing as preferring to split work part time with family duties as some women have chosen, or perhaps seeking part-time work to accommodate a spouse with a higher-paying job.

Under this suit, those who take a job because it's what's available in this economy until a better one comes along are discounted. And any diversity of talents, experience or career goals is dismissed.

Yet all of these factors are common among Wal-Mart workers, the result of free choice in a flexible, free, labor market. It more accurately explains differences in how many men or women end up as managers.

But in this lawsuit, justice comes only in inhuman numbers — statistics. If there are more male managers than female, then the six individual cases mean the entire company discriminates against all 1.6 million, making every female employee some sort of robot victim.

This suit is really about extorting a multibillion-dollar payout with big lawyer fees from a retail giant with $405 billion in annual sales worldwide.

If every apparent discrepancy in equality becomes the standard for legal action, it will be women who suffer.

Only the best managers will be hired, and jobs will only be available if equal numbers of men are present — no matter what the department.

The labor market will become less flexible, less free, less competent and after the cash is extorted from the case, weaker than ever as copycats follow precedent.

As we said, the Supreme Court seems highly skeptical. We hope it is, and that it throws this legal monstrosity out as fast as it can.

Kent Greenfield, columnist, on The Huffington Post: "If the questions earlier this week at the Supreme Court hearing about the huge discrimination suit again Wal-Mart are any indication, it looks like hundreds of thousands of women are about to lose. ... When a culture of discrimination is pervasive -- whether it be about gender, race, class, or sexual orientation, and whether it be in a business, a school, or society in general -- the best way to give it power is to give people the freedom to act on it. We should not assume that culture only has power when it is enacted in law by way of company manual, city ordinance, or congressional act. The more powerful a cultural norm, the less it needs such enforcement. The fact that discretion is present where decisions are made is not a cure for a discriminatory culture. Rather, discretion is its perfect cover."

Victoria Pynchon, blogger, on Forbes: "The Supreme Court can narrow the discussion to the evidentiary question presented to it in a cultural vacuum or it can address the broader policy issue -- whether the inability to prove the effects of implicit bias on a case-by-case basis should permit employees to use social science research to prove that the system itself is implicitly rigged against them. In the meantime, those employers that are not taking steps to craft pay and promotion criteria to encourage equity among the genders are failing themselves and their customers as well as more than half their workforce. The energy ... of women workers is a terrible thing to waste."

Barbara Ehrenreich, contributor, on The American Prospect: "If Wal-Mart is a life form, it is an unclassifiable one, at least in ordinary terrestrial terms. It eats, devouring acre after acre and town after town. It grows without limit, sometimes assuming new names -- Walmex in Mexico, Asda in the U.K. -- to trick the unwary. Yet in its defense in the Dukes v. Wal-Mart suit, Wal-Mart claims to have no idea what it's doing. This could be a metaphor for capitalism or perhaps a sign that a successful alien invasion is in progress. The only thing that's for sure is, should the Supreme Court decide in favor of Wal-Mart, we'll have a lot more of these creatures running around: monstrously oversized 'persons' who insist that they can't control their own actions."

The Wall Street Journal, in an editorial: "Far from being a passive enabler, Wal-Mart also had strong antidiscrimination policies in place at its stores. While individual managers may have made questionable decisions, those actions or their impact on women can't all legally be ascribed to the company. ... In its 1977 Teamsters decision, the Supreme Court ruled that defendants accused of systemic discrimination have the right to address the claims of their accusers individually, and the same should apply here. Trial lawyers may have figured that targeting an unsympathetic company like Wal-Mart would offer enough political momentum to carry the day, but their legal theories are an affront to the law and common sense."

(New York) Daily News, in an editorial: "America's legal system is built on the presentation of specific, individualized allegations and fair opportunity to rebut them. ... The courts are not to be places where sweeping wrongdoing is divined through statistical calculations and sociological mumbo jumbo. And this fundamental proposition holds true even when the alleged evildoer in question is a corporate behemoth much reviled for everything except the everyday low prices that are so beloved of millions."

A class action against Wal-Mart Stores, filed nearly 10 years ago, aimed to address alleged discrimination against female employees who were denied equal pay or unfairly overlooked for promotions. Six women initially came forward; a California federal trial judge eventually allowed the suit to proceed on behalf of ''all women who have worked at Wal-Mart since 1998''. Roughly 1.5million current and former employees could be affected. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court took up the Wal- Mart case to determine whether it should be allowed to advance. It is a close call, but on balance we think it should not in its current form. Lawyers for the plaintiffs argue that female employees have been hurt by the company's policy of giving local managers discretion in personnel decisions. But if this discretion is nearly absolute, then how could the company itself be held accountable for an allegedly discriminatory nationwide policy?

 The diversity of the class in terms of geography and job type also raises concerns. The court may well decide that the class as currently structured is not workable. But in no case should the justices rule in a manner that would thwart the chances of having the women's grievances addressed. This editorial extract appeared in Wednesday's Washington Post.

The Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court weren't taking prisoners on Tuesday as the Court heard oral arguments in an enormous employment discrimination suit against retail giant Wal-Mart. If their skepticism is any guide, it may presage the end of a vast new plaintiffs lawyer jackpot.

In Wal-Mart Inc Stores v. Dukes, the Justices will decide whether thousands of women who have worked for Wal-Mart may be certified as a class in an employment discrimination case against the company. If the case is allowed to proceed, it would lump together disparate cases as evidence of systemic discrimination by the world's largest retailer, with potential liability in the billions.

That prospect has implications well beyond Wal-Mart, which employs 1.4 million Americans. Trial lawyers love class-action suits, which typically involve business products, because they increase the incentive for companies to settle -- and thus advance the chances of a big lawyer payday. Discrimination cases are especially unsuited to class status, however, because they involve individual behavior. If the lawyers can ring up Wal-Mart for monetary awards based on a matrix of statistics, economic models and adventures in sociology, every company in America could soon be a target.

Wal-Mart employee Betty Dukes and five other women first alleged discrimination in 2001, and the lawyers have been trying to expand that to encompass every woman who has worked at Wal-Mart since 1998. Last April, a divided en banc panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a district judge's ruling that allowed the case to proceed as a class. Liberals hope the case will be a seminal moment for gender-discrimination claims, and the Obama Administration filed an amicus brief on the Ninth Circuit supporting the women.

But as the Supreme Court seemed to agree Tuesday, finding commonality among so many far flung cases isn't easy. For example, the plaintiffs lawyers have alleged that some women were victimized by a supervisor's decision to hold a business lunch at Hooters, a restaurant chain known for its, er, waitresses. Another woman complained that her manager tended to yell at her, but not at her male counterparts.

Plaintiffs attorney Joseph Sellers claimed that the lack of record keeping at the stores meant that the use of "a formula would be more reliable than individualized hearings." The plaintiffs love that idea because it means that companies can be accused and found guilty of discrimination merely based on statistical disparities.

But that didn't sit well with Justice Anthony Kennedy, who asked, "If Wal-Mart's process is truly 'standardless and recordless,' then why is there commonality?" As Justice Samuel Alito also put it: "So you have the company that is absolutely typical of the entire American work force, and let's say . . . there weren't any variations. Every single company exactly the same profile. Then you would say every single company is in violation" of the law? Mr. Sellers said "that could very well be the case."

The Justices were also concerned that denying the company the ability to defend itself against individual claims would violate due process, and that it could result in awards to class members who were never victims of discrimination.

"Didn't the district judge say because of the numbers we couldn't possibly have the hearing in each case on whether the particular woman was owed back pay?" asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who made her name as a lawyer arguing gender discrimination cases.

Added Justice Sonia Sotomayor: "I'm a little confused. . . . You're going to say, through my statistical model, I will be able to identify those women in the class who are deserving of pay raises. What that doesn't answer is when in this process the defendant is going to be given an opportunity to defend against that finding."

Far from being a passive enabler, Wal-Mart also had strong antidiscrimination policies in place at its stores. While individual managers may have made questionable decisions, those actions or their impact on women can't all legally be ascribed to the company. With thousands of stores across the country Chief Justice John Roberts noted, "you're going to have some bad apples."

In its 1977 Teamsters decision, the Supreme Court ruled that defendants accused of systemic discrimination have the right to address the claims of their accusers individually, and the same should apply here. Trial lawyers may have figured that targeted an unsympathetic company like Wal-Mart would offer enough political momentum to carry the day, but their legal theories are an affront to the law and common sense.

Wal-Mart plans return to its one-stop roots ; Cutting back on products was a mistake, chief executives says

The world's largest retailer needs to get back to its roots as the lowest priced one-stop-shop for consumers, Wal-Mart's U.S. CEO Bill Simon told USA TODAY on Wednesday

Wal-Mart, which has had seven-consecutive quarters of sales declines in the U.S., erred in cutting back on the number of products it offers and getting away from its theme of everyday low prices, Simon says.

Costly remodels of stores made it difficult for Wal-Mart to lower prices as much or as often as it would have normally. These factors prompted customers to flee to competitors, Simon says.

Efforts to streamline its inventory by reducing the number of brands of, say, tools, also hit the company hard. Simon says customers who might have browsed for hardware on their once-diverse shelves stopped coming, so the store is bringing back the brands it dropped.

Other plans:

The huge cut proposed by the Federal Reserve Board in the fees retailers pay on debit card transactions would reduce Wal-Mart's costs enough that it could cut prices. "Any reduction in cost or expense anywhere goes to the customer," Simon says.

Wal-Mart is considering whether it needs to polish its image a bit after the drubbing it's taken on its sex discrimination case before the Supreme Court.

The company's female managers have complained that their success stories have not been adequately told, he says.

Wal-Mart will open 30 to 40 smaller format stores this year. About half will be about 15,000-square-foot Walmart Express stores, and half will be 30,000- to 60,000-square-foot "neighborhood markets" that are full-scale grocery stores. Walmart Supercenters are now about 180,000 square feet.

Simon says Wal-Mart was able to hang onto many of the higher- income customers it attracted during the recession.

Its missteps in pricing and product selection drove some of these customers away, but at about the same rate it turned off lower- income shoppers, he says.

John Long, a retail strategist with consulting firm Kurt Salmon, says Wal-Mart's strategy to keep wealthier customers "didn't work too well."

But he believes bigger factors may be at play.

"Everybody thought the intensity and depth of the recession might produce remarkable behavior shifts," Long says.

"To some degree they may have, but they are more attitudinal in nature than loyalty related."

Much rides on Wal-Mart sexism case

Earlier this week, a crucial moment in the fight for gender equality in the workplace occurred when the U.S. Supreme Court began hearing arguments in the biggest class-action lawsuit in history. In the suit, first filed 10 years ago, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is accused by as many as one million current and former women employees of systemic gender bias in hiring, pay and promotion.

In essence, the court is being asked to judge whether abundant evidence of gender bias throughout society trumps much harder to obtain evidence of specific incidents of alleged maltreatment at a given employer.

Decisions on employment practices are notoriously subjective. The continued gender discrimination in the workplace, whether at Bay Street law firms or at Zellers, usually turns on a manager's gut feeling and not an employee's tangible record of achievement.

Wal-Mart, in trying to stop this case in its tracks, falls back on the usual excuses in cases where corporate conduct is under scrutiny. It says it has never condoned discrimination, of course. And it insists that any acts of gender bias are isolated incidents by rogue local managers.

"The evidence is contrary of [bias]," claims Wal-Mart lawyer Theodore Boutrous.

But that assertion is at odds with the sworn depositions of more than 100 of Wal-Mart's women employees. And also with that of the San Francisco trial court judge who ruled the Wal-Mart case could proceed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

That judge said his ruling derived from "largely uncontested, descriptive statistics which show that women working in Wal-Mart stores are paid less than men in every region, that pay disparities exist in most job categories, that the salary gap widens over time, that women take longer to enter into management positions, and that the higher one looks in the organization, the lower the percentage of women."

You might think just from the achievements of German chancellor Angela Merkel, astronaut and scientist Roberta Bondar, and the women CEOs at Kraft Foods Inc., PepsiCo Inc. and Guelph-based Linamar Corp., which Linda Hassenfratz has expanded into a thriving multinational in the teeth of the worst automaking downturn since the Great Depression, that women can do anything.

But if Wal-Mart CEO Mike Duke, who pulled down $19.2 million (U.S.) in pay last year compared with the average female Wal-Mart employee's $13,000 in 2001 when the class-action suit was first filed, needs more specific evidence, it exists in abundance.

Among my favourite cases are the world-renowned orchestras that were confronted some years ago with accusations of gender bias. When their hiring committees finally were persuaded to conduct "blind auditions," there was a 50 per cent jump in women advancing from preliminary rounds of consideration. And the likelihood of the women candidates being hired increased by several multiples.

If the Supremes decide Wal-Mart isn't immune from the widespread gender bias in society, and find accordingly for the plaintiffs, they will make history in demolishing barriers to women's advancement. But if they choose not to hear the case, the justices will greatly weaken class actions as a device for achieving justice.

A court dominated by GOP appointees appears poised to do just that, going by the hostile reaction of justices to arguments by the plaintiffs' lawyers. Only the top court's three women justices, all Democrat appointees, appeared receptive to them earlier this week.

"Litigation by individuals ... is just too costly," says John Coffee, a Columbia University law professor and long-time student of corporate ethics. "It's either class action or nothing."

The obvious irony here is that gender bias is counterproductive.

Wal-Mart's women employees account for 71 per cent of the firm's global workforce. That includes Canada, where Wal-Mart is the nation's biggest general merchandiser.

How productive might one expect those workers to be when their treatment as second-class employees grinds at them every working hour? When they continue to be fair game for sexist remarks from the assistant produce manager?

And so, in addition to the navigational nightmare that Wal-Mart's stadium-sized stores can be, the company further hobbles itself with a largely discontented workforce.

These are not employees in a frame of mind to guide a customer, with enthusiasm, to the obscure location of the picture frames or No. 3 wood screws. Or to brightly "up-sell" customers on goods they didn't know they wanted.

One remedy is to lessen the gut-instinct effect by having employers more carefully codify employment practices.

"Those employers that are not taking steps to craft pay and promotion criteria to encourage equity among the genders are failing themselves and their customers as well as more than half the workforce," Forbes legal columnist Victoria Pynchon writes of the Wal-Mart case.

"The energy and potential of women workers is a terrible thing to waste."

True, but we keep doing it. A more effective remedy is for us to do business only with employers known to treat all their workers with dignity and respect.

March 31--Wal-Mart's in the middle of a national advertising blitz featuring an assistant store manager who just happens to be a woman. The beaming woman says she was able to leave welfare and buy her own home, thanks to the pay raises and promotions she received from Wal-Mart.

"Everything started changing for the better when I was hired by Wal-Mart," she says in the ad.

I have no doubt this woman exists. The question before the U.S. Supreme Court this week is whether the company in the ad exists -- and how much liability that airbrushed company should face for discriminating against female employees.

The Supreme Court seems poised to side with Wal-Mart, at least in part. I'm hoping they can do so without entirely gutting the rights of ordinary folks who work for large employers -- including the 10,000 people in Oregon who work for Wal-Mart.

Or the 15,000 people in Oregon employed by Intel, which filed a brief supporting Wal-Mart.

Or the thousands of people in Oregon who work for other large companies lining up with Wal-Mart, including Hewlett-Packard, Walgreens, Costco and Bank of America. If the court accepts all of Wal-Mart's arguments, it will become very difficult for such workers to band together to fight acts of corporate discrimination or wrongdoing.

Wal-Mart faces a class-action lawsuit brought by women who allege the company has a clear pattern of paying women less and passing them over for promotions, though those women tend to have more experience and higher performance ratings than their male peers. The plaintiffs in Wal-Mart v. Dukes have reams of pay data to back up their claims. They also have toe-curling anecdotes about Wal-Mart's corporate culture -- stories that include meetings at Hooters restaurants and outings to strip clubs.

The stories also cover the more routine and subtle forms of discrimination: Management jobs doled out to male buddies rather than posted. Women paid 5 to 15 percent less for identical jobs -- but rarely knowing about the pay gap, since employees are discouraged from discussing wages. Women turned down for promotions or management training, specifically because they were married and had children (or because they didn't and should).

Naturally, Wal-Mart says it is unfairly targeted as a large corporation with deep pockets. It says its employment practices are highly nondiscriminatory, and that if any act of discrimination were to occur, it would be because of the occasional rogue store manager using his discretion inappropriately. Disputes should be litigated individually, not lumped together in a way that limits a corporation's due process rights, Wal-Mart says.

The court's conservative wing appeared sympathetic during Tuesday's oral arguments to Wal-Mart's case. Also, Justice Anthony Kennedy, a possible swing vote in this dispute, seemed baffled by the concept that an employer could discriminate against women without formal policies to do so.

(The three women justices didn't appear to share his puzzlement.)

In Wal-Mart's defense, I do think the retail giant and its corporate allies make some good legal points. There are several different kinds of class-action lawsuits, and the lower courts may have been too quick to certify this particular kind of class-action case. The Supreme Court does need to push back on the most liberal interpretations of class-action law, or corporations may no longer be able to defend themselves fairly in court.

Those corporations include major Oregon players such as Intel. The semiconductor manufacturer said in its brief that large companies can be severely damaged by permissive class-action procedures that encourage frivolous lawsuits and allow outsized damages.

Yet Wal-Mart doesn't just want to win this case. It also hopes the Supreme Court will use the dispute to dramatically curb the ability of workers to file class-action suits. If the Supreme Court agreed entirely with Wal-Mart, large corporations could have nearly unfettered ability to shortchange certain workers without fear of class-action reprisal, because the bar for qualifying for class-action status would be set so high.

Lower-wage workers would take the brunt of that ruling, because they're the least equipped to hire their own attorneys and prevail in individual cases.

The case before the high court began a decade ago as an individual suit filed by a Wal-Mart greeter who said she was underpaid and passed over. The case mushroomed into a class-action suit involving scores of witnesses and hundreds of thousands of plaintiffs. Wal-Mart has improved some of its labor practices since then, in no small part because of the bad publicity and legal pressure.

Which brings us back to the beaming woman in the ad. Without the threat of a big class-action lawsuit, Wal-Mart wouldn't need to run so many warm and fuzzy promotional ads.

Or work so hard to find actual women managers to appear in them.

March 31--If not for a class-action lawsuit, many of the women who maintain Wal-Mart treated them unfairly will never get their day in court.

On Tuesday the Supreme Court appeared divided as it heard arguments and asked questions in a case that alleges the country's largest retailer and biggest employer paid female workers less than their male counterparts and offered fewer opportunities for promotion. The high court's decision will determine if the women -- possibly as many as 1.5 million of them -- can make their claim in a single, class-action lawsuit.

The Supreme Court will likely announce in June its decision in Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes. The plaintiffs appear to face an uphill battle, given the comments by some of the conservative justices on Tuesday.

Denying the chance to bring a class-action suit will in effect kill the case. The women who believe Wal-Martdiscriminated against them do not have the ability or means to bring individual lawsuits. This pro-business court, which just 14 months ago lifted limits on corporate and labor union spending in campaigns for president and Congress, appears reluctant to empower Wal-Mart workers in their effort to take on the corporate giant.

The plaintiffs argue that Wal-Mart culture was "rife with gender stereotypes" -- some stores held staff meetings at Hooters restaurants -- and they have sworn statements and statistics to back up their claims.

Wal-Mart denies the charge and maintains it has a strict anti-discrimination policy. And it argues that the class action is unwarranted, given that the alleged victims worked in 3,400 stores and 170 job classifications.

That shouldn't matter, given that the plaintiffs all make similar claims against a single, corporate defendant. The U.S. District Court in San Francisco granted the class status in 2004, and later the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals there voted to allow the class action to proceed. The Supreme Court should do likewise.

The plaintiffs deserve the chance to make their case.

World
Walmart may avoid lawsuit by 1.6 million women

THE US Supreme Court appears ready to block a massive sex discrimination lawsuit against Walmart on behalf of up to 1.6 million women, and that could make it harder for other workers nationwide to bring class-action claims against large employers.

The 10-year-old lawsuit, argued in lively exchanges at the court, claims that Wal-Mart Stores, the world’s largest employer, favours men over women in pay and promotions.

Billions of dollars are at stake if it is allowed to go forward.

The case for now is the largest class action in US history, but the five-member conservative majority on the nine-member high court may derail it, judging by comments from the bench during argument.

The case could affect the future of other class-action lawsuits that pool modest individual claims into a single action that creates the potential for a large judgement and increases the pressure on businesses to settle.

In the arguments, several justices suggested they were troubled by the case and lower-court decisions against Arkansas-based Walmart. Estimates of how many women could be included in the lawsuit run from 500,000 to 1.6 million.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, a key swing vote who normally helps form the five-member conservative majority, said, "It’s not clear to me: What is the unlawful policy that Walmart has adopted, under your theory of the case?"

Plaintiffs attorney Joseph Sellers said Walmart store managers have been given "unchecked discretion", and they use it to discriminate against women.

Kennedy said the complaint "faces in two directions. ... You said this is a culture where ... the company headquarters knows everything that’s going on. Then ... you say ... these supervisors have too much discretion. It seems to me there’s an inconsistency there, and I’m just not sure what the unlawful policy is."

Kennedy was seconded by fellow conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.

CNN also reported the female workers were facing an uphill battle, saying the narrow conservative majority appeared sceptical about allowing workers from across the country to file one suit and undergo one trial.

The court’s three female members — liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — appeared to favour the plaintiffs.

The Supreme Court is not reviewing the merits of the suit — whether Walmart is guilty of discrimination against women — but whether the enormous class action should be allowed to proceed.

The case started in San Francisco in 2001 when six women filed suit claiming discrimination, in part because they were passed over for promotion in favour of men. One says she was told, "It’s a man’s world."

"This nationwide class includes every woman employed for any period of time over the past decade, in any of Walmart’s approximately 3,400 separately managed stores, 41 regions and 400 districts, and who held positions in any of approximately 53 departments and 170 different job classifications," the company’s petition to the Supreme Court said.

"The millions of class members collectively seek billions of dollars in monetary relief under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, claiming that tens of thousands of Walmart managers inflicted monetary injury on each and every individual class member in the same manner by intentionally discriminating against them because of their sex, in violation of the company’s express anti-discrimination policy."

A federal appeals court panel and the full US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, both divided, approved the certification of the class.

The Supreme Court should hand down a decision before the summer recess in late June or early July.

Justices hear arguments on allowing Wal-Mart lawsuit; U.S. high court’s decision could lead to 1.5 million women seeking back pay

The U.S. Supreme Court appeared closely divided during arguments over the theory put forth by the plaintiffs in an enormous sex discrimination class-action case against Wal-Mart Stores.

Even some justices who seemed sympathetic to the plaintiffs Tuesday expressed qualms about how to administer a lawsuit involving as many as 1.5 million women seeking back pay that could amount to billions of dollars. Others appeared worried about the consequences for other businesses of a ruling that would allow the case against Wal-Mart to go forward.

The mere certification of a class action can prompt defendants to settle in light of the sums at stake, and the justices struggled to find a way to distinguish between gaps in pay that might have benign explanations and those caused by unlawful discrimination.

The court of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has recently issued a series of rulings in favor of plaintiffs suing for employment discrimination that cut against the court’s pro-business reputation. The Wal-Mart case dwarfs those rulings in importance. It is the largest employment discrimination class action in history, and the court’s decision, expected by June, will probably be its most important business ruling this term.

The issue before the justices at Tuesday’s arguments was not whether Wal-Mart, the U.S.’s largest retailer and biggest private employer, had discriminated against women who worked there. For now, the question in the case, Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, is whether hundreds of thousands of female workers have enough in common to join together in a single lawsuit.

The plaintiffs’ theory is that a centralized companywide policy gave local managers too much discretion in pay and promotion decisions, leaving Wal-Mart vulnerable to gender stereotypes. The plaintiffs have presented sworn statements and statistics to support their claim.

Wal-Mart calls that evidence unrepresentative and unreliable. The company says its policies expressly bar discrimination and promote diversity. In any event, the company says, the plaintiffs — who worked in 3,400 stores in 170 job classifications — do not have enough in common to warrant class-action treatment.

Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the theory about the alleged discrimination — through a central policy conferring local discretion — was internally inconsistent. ‘‘Your complaint faces in two directions,’’ he told a lawyer for the plaintiffs.

But Justice Stephen G. Breyer said Wal-Mart could be held accountable if it had failed to take action in the face of reports of discrimination from its stores. ‘‘Should central management under the law have withdrawn some of the subjective discretion in order to stop these results?’’ Justice Breyer asked.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed, saying that companies had a responsibility to make sure that women were treated fairly in local workplaces. And Justice Elena Kagan said that ‘‘excessive subjectivity’’ might be a policy that violated civil rights laws.

But Justice Antonin Scalia was unconvinced.

‘‘I’m getting whipsawed here,’’ he told the plaintiffs’ lawyer, Joseph M. Sellers. ‘‘On the one hand, you say the problem is that they were utterly subjective, and on the other hand you say there is strong corporate culture that guides all of this. Well, which is it?’’

Mr. Sellers responded that ‘‘there is this broad discretion given the managers’’ but that ‘‘they do not make their decisions in a vacuum.’’ Managers, he went on, ‘‘are informed by the company about how to exercise that discretion.’’

That did not satisfy Justice Scalia. ‘‘If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion,’’ he said, ‘‘you don’t have discretion.’’

Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for Wal-Mart, said the handful of women named as plaintiffs who seek to represent the entire class did not have typical experiences at the company.

The Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court weren't taking prisoners on Tuesday as the Court heard oral arguments in an enormous employment discrimination suit against retail giant Wal-Mart. If their skepticism is any guide, it may presage the end of a vast new plaintiffs lawyer jackpot.

In Wal-Mart Inc Stores v. Dukes, the Justices will decide whether thousands of women who have worked for Wal-Mart may be certified as a class in an employment discrimination case against the company. If the case is allowed to proceed, it would lump together disparate cases as evidence of systemic discrimination by the world's largest retailer, with potential liability in the billions.

That prospect has implications well beyond Wal-Mart, which employs 1.4 million Americans. Trial lawyers love class-action suits, which typically involve business products, because they increase the incentive for companies to settle -- and thus advance the chances of a big lawyer payday. Discrimination cases are especially unsuited to class status, however, because they involve individual behavior. If the lawyers can ring up Wal-Mart for monetary awards based on a matrix of statistics, economic models and adventures in sociology, every company in America could soon be a target.

Wal-Mart employee Betty Dukes and five other women first alleged discrimination in 2001, and the lawyers have been trying to expand that to encompass every woman who has worked at Wal-Mart since 1998. Last April, a divided en banc panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a district judge's ruling that allowed the case to proceed as a class. Liberals hope the case will be a seminal moment for gender discrimination claims, and the Obama Administration filed an amicus brief supporting the women.

But as the Supreme Court seemed to agree Tuesday, finding commonality among so many far flung cases isn't easy. For example, the plaintiffs lawyers have alleged that some women were victimized by a supervisor's decision to hold a business lunch at Hooters, a restaurant chain known for its, er, waitresses. Another woman complained that her manager tended to yell at her, but not at her male counterparts.

Plaintiffs attorney Joseph Sellers claimed that the lack of record keeping at the stores meant that the use of "a formula would be more reliable than individualized hearings." The plaintiffs love that idea because it means that companies can be found guilty of discrimination merely based on statistical disparities.

But that didn't sit well with Justice Anthony Kennedy, who asked, "If Wal-Mart's process is truly 'standardless and recordless,' then why is there commonality?" As Justice Samuel Alito also put it: "So you have the company that is absolutely typical of the entire American work force, and let's say . . . there weren't any variations. Every single company exactly the same profile. Then you would say every single company is in violation" of the law? Mr. Sellers said "that could very well be the case."

Far from being a passive enabler, Wal-Mart also had strong antidiscrimination policies in place at its stores. While individual managers may have made questionable decisions, those actions or their impact on women can't all legally be ascribed to the company. With thousands of stores across the country Chief Justice John Roberts noted, "you're going to have some bad apples."

In its 1977 Teamsters decision, the Supreme Court ruled that defendants accused of systemic discrimination have the right to address the claims of their accusers individually. The same should apply here.

T echnically, the litigants in the case before the Supreme Court on Tuesday were Wal-Mart Stores and some 1 million current and former female employees who allege in a class action that they have been discriminated against. But all eyes will be on the justices themselves.

Will the "conservatives" on the court reflexively side with big corporate interests, as some liberal activists fear? Or, as some conservatives worry, will the "liberals" on the court get their way and craft a decision that gives the "little guy" a boost against the corporate behemoth?

It's easy in cases such as this one to try to caricature justices as political players in search of a desired result. Easy, but wrong, as a recent spate of decisions shows.

Within the past few weeks, the Supreme Court, with conservative justices in agreement, rendered decisions that caused corporate America to groan. In one case, the justices sided with an employee who claimed his employer retaliated against him after he made a complaint. In another, they unanimously gave a green light to investors who sued a drugmaker accused of withholding information about serious side effects linked to one of its products. And the court, in a decision written by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., an appointee of George W. Bush, rebuffed AT&T's argument that it was entitled to "personal privacy" in order to shield certain information from public view. The chief justice, with tongue firmly planted in cheek, wrote that the court hoped "AT&T would not take it personally."

An analysis by Supreme Court advocate Thomas Goldstein on SCOTUSblog also chips away at the notion that justices rule in lockstep with their political preferences and are constantly at each other's throats. In the 2010 essay "Everything you read about the Supreme Court is wrong," Mr. Goldstein notes that 5-to-4 splits were rendered in less than 20 percent of the cases during the court's 2009 term - the most recent term for which full statistics are available. During the '09 term, "roughly half the decisions were nine to zero."

Justices are not devoid of points of view, and their "judicial philosophies" help steer them to certain results. There will be cases in which the justices appear to split along ideological lines, and the Wal-Mart case may very well be one of them. Debate and disagreement over the merits of a decision are understandable; not so painting justices as mere political hacks camouflaged in judicial robes.

The U.S. Supreme Court is weighing whether discrimination claims by six women who worked in 13 Walmart stores can become a class action encompassing as many as 1.6 million women who now toil or once toiled in the retailer's 3,400 outlets. The question is preposterous, and the answer must be no.

America's legal system is built on the presentation of specific, individualized allegations and fair opportunity to rebut them with contrary evidence. The courts are not to be places where sweeping wrongdoing is divined through statistical calculations and sociological mumbo jumbo.

And this fundamental proposition holds true even when the alleged evildoer in question is a corporate behemoth much reviled for everything except the everyday low prices that are so beloved of millions.

The six women who charge they were paid less than comparable male co-workers or denied promotions that went more readily and speedily to men may well have been wronged. They are entitled to their days in court on the particulars.

Their lawyer, however, had much grander ambitions. By amassing statistics showing that in each of Walmart's 41 regions, women were underrepresented in management compared with men and paid less than men, he has depicted his half-dozen clients as representing the victimization of every woman who works for Walmart.

Two lower courts bought that argument, never mind that the retailer's unchallenged data showed no significant discrepancy between pay of men and women at 90% of its outlets. The lower-court rulings concluded Walmart should have to answer for allegedly discriminating on a mass scale based on the claimants' statistical extrapolations.

If that legal thinking is upheld, then every woman in America can band together into a class to sue every employer in America. No joke.

It's well known that women at large are paid less than men in similar positions, a phenomenon that has been attributed far less to discrimination than to women's choices in the workplace.

Amid generally skeptical questioning at the Supreme Court's oral argument session Tuesday, Justice Samuel Alito got to the heart of the matter. He asked the claimants' attorney: "So you have the company that is absolutely typical of the entire American workforce. Then you would say every single company is in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act?"

"That could very well be the case," the lawyer answered.

As previously stated: Preposterous.

Justice does not come in one-size-fits-all.

On Tuesday the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in a 10-year- old case in which Wal-Mart is being accused of discriminating against seven of its female employees. The debate was not over whether discrimination occurred, but whether the case could become a class-action lawsuit, under the premise the company systematically paid women less than men and awarded fewer promotions to women in its 3,400 stores nationwide.

Turning the case into class-action litigation could turn more than 1 million current and former Wal-Mart female workers into plaintiffs and increase Wal-Mart's potential liability by billions of dollars.

The case, Wal-Mart v. Dukes, is being watched closely by businesses, who fear they could be targeted for equal employment opportunity litigation based on nothing more than statistics, and by plaintiffs' lawyers, who could rake in huge contingency fees.

A number of justices asked pointed questions about the practical application of trying to award fair compensation to so many diverse plaintiffs, some with major claims and some with no justifiable claims whatsoever. In fact, Wal-Mart's attorney, Theodore Boutrous Jr., pointed out that the company has 544 female store managers who could conceivably be treated as both plaintiffs and defendants under a class-action scenario.

There was also some question about apparently self-contradictory arguments from the women's attorney, Joseph Sellers. Justice Antonin Scalia complained, "I'm getting whipsawed here."

Justice Scalia said Mr. Sellers appeared to be arguing that the store managers were not well enough guided from headquarters in how to treat women fairly, but, conversely, that there also was "a strong corporate culture that guides all this. Well, which is it?"

Justice Scalia also scoffed at the concept of using a statistical model for the sake of efficiency to determine discrimination because the circumstances involved occurred a decade ago and memories are unreliable. "We should use that in jury trials, too, for really old cases. We should just put a statistical model before the jury and say, you know, this stuff is too old; so, we'll ... We'll do it on the basis of - is this really due process?"

Justice demands that individuals and their specific circumstances be treated individually, not as some amorphous blob of would-be tort jackpot recipients based on vague statistical probability.

A ruling for class-action status could also devastate any hopes of job creation by major industries in this country for decades to come. This is not to say true employment discrimination should not be actively and aggressively pursued in the courts, merely that clumping everyone together into a statistical bale denies both sides true justice.

U.S. News: Court Weighs Bias Claim --- Justices Skeptical of Arguments to Allow Class-Action Status in Wal-Mart Suit

WASHINGTON -- A class-action lawsuit against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. appeared unlikely to survive after Tuesday's Supreme Court arguments, where justices suggested the suit was unfair both to the nation's largest retailer and many of the women who allegedly were victimized.

The lawsuit accused Wal-Mart of systematically paying as many as three million current and former female workers less than men and providing them fewer opportunities for promotion. Wal-Mart denies the claims, which could total billions of dollars in back pay and punitive damages, and says it has a strict antidiscrimination policy.

The case potentially could set new standards for future employment class action. Much of corporate America, including Altria Group Inc., General Electric Co., Microsoft Corp. and Tyson Foods Inc., has backed Wal-Mart, arguing that a plaintiff victory could open the door to unprecedented liability.

But civil rights, women's rights and labor rights groups have sided with the plaintiffs, contending that a sweeping class action is one of few effective tools against ingrained discrimination in the workplace.

The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the suit, filed in 2001, could proceed in its current form. It has yet to go to trial because Wal-Mart contends the alleged victims, who worked in 170 job classifications across 3,400 stores, have too little in common to qualify for a single class action suit.

The plaintiffs allege that regardless of the varying job classifications and store locations, the women all suffered from the same discriminatory practices in a corporate culture "rife with gender stereotypes."

On average, each woman who worked at Wal-Mart would be entitled to about $1,100 in back pay, according the plaintiffs' brief filed with the Court.

At Tuesday arguments, conservative justices challenged the lawsuit's premise, which alleges that Wal-Mart maintained a "pattern and practice" of discrimination -- a legal standard for liability -- by granting local managers wide discretion in employment decisions.

Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy pressed Joseph Sellers, the attorney representing a half-dozen women who seek to represent the massive class. On the one hand, the plaintiffs allege that "Arkansas knows everything," Kennedy said, referring to Wal-Mart's home state. But on the other, individual managers have too much autonomy.

Mr. Sellers argued the two pieces fit together. He said corporate policy gave local managers unfettered discretion to underpay women. And prejudice against women, was part of what he contended was a centralized corporate culture the company calls "the Wal-Mart Way."

Because the plaintiffs' claims are based on statistical evidence of pay and promotions that favor men over women, Justice Samuel Alito asked if that meant "every single company" in the country could potentially be in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination.

Possibly so, Mr. Sellers said.

Liberal justices were more open to the plaintiffs' theory. The common policy, Justice Elena Kagan said, permitted "excessive subjectivity," allowing gender discrimination to influence employment decisions.

To qualify as a class action, Justice Kagan said, plaintiffs need only show "that there is a practice, a policy of subjectivity that on the whole results in discrimination against women, not that each one of those women in the class were themselves discriminated against."

The plaintiffs say their statistical and anecdotal evidence should be enough to get their case before a jury. They say, for instance, that while women outnumber men 2-1 in Wal-Mart's hourly positions, the ratio is reversed in management ranks. And they say that such practices as holding staff meetings at Hooters restaurants support their claim regarding the company's allegedly discriminatory culture.

Wal-Mart responds that the plaintiffs' statistics don't show that disparities between men and women are caused by discrimination, and dismisses the anecdotes as "widely divergent, and often entirely unique, events."

Wal-Mart also claims that its statistical study done on a store-by-store basis shows no pay disparity between male and female workers.

"The case doesn't look promising for plaintiffs based on the questions the justices asked," said Alexandra Lahav, a professor of law at the University of Connecticut School of Law.

The justices also are considering whether back pay can be awarded in class action suits where injunctive relief is sought. Until now, all courts have agreed that it can. "Removing back pay would be a huge change," Ms. Lahav said.

U.S. District Judge Martin Jenkins, in San Francisco, granted the case class status in June 2004. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco voted 6-5 to permit the class action to proceed, with some modifications.

The appeals court said women who left Wal-Mart before the original suit was filed in June 2001 shouldn't be considered part of the class, but left it up to a trial judge to consider whether to certify their claims under a different legal standard.

More than 100 women gave depositions telling stories similar to those of the named plaintiffs. "We talked to hundreds more, but many were too scared to stand up," said Betty Lawrence, a plaintiffs lawyer.

"We continue to have strong anti-discrimination policies in place, a strong record of advancement of women and we are always looking to be better," said Gisel Ruiz, a company executive vice president, in a statement.

The Wal-Mart Watershed

The Justices of the Supreme Court weren't taking prisoners on Tuesday as the Court heard oral arguments in an enormous employment discrimination suit against retail giant Wal-Mart. If their skepticism is any guide, it may presage the end of a vast new plaintiffs lawyer jackpot.

In Wal-Mart Inc Stores v. Dukes, the Justices will decide whether thousands of women who have worked for Wal-Mart may be certified as a class in an employment discrimination case against the company. If the case is allowed to proceed, it would lump together disparate cases as evidence of systemic discrimination by the world's largest retailer, with potential liability in the billions.

That prospect has implications well beyond Wal-Mart, which employs 1.4 million Americans. Trial lawyers love class-action suits, which typically involve business products, because they increase the incentive for companies to settle -- and thus advance the chances of a big lawyer payday. Discrimination cases are especially unsuited to class status, however, because they involve individual behavior. If the lawyers can ring up Wal-Mart for monetary awards based on a matrix of statistics, economic models and adventures in sociology, every company in America could soon be a target.

Wal-Mart employee Betty Dukes and five other women first alleged discrimination in 2001, and the lawyers have been trying to expand that to encompass every woman who has worked at Wal-Mart since 1998. Last April, a divided en banc panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a district judge's ruling that allowed the case to proceed as a class. Liberals hope the case will be a seminal moment for gender discrimination claims, and the Obama Administration filed an amicus brief supporting the women.

But as the Supreme Court seemed to agree yesterday, finding commonality among so many far flung cases isn't easy. For example, the plaintiffs lawyers have alleged that some women were victimized by a supervisor's decision to hold a business lunch at Hooters, a restaurant chain known for its, er, waitresses. Another woman complained that her manager tended to yell at her, but not at her male counterparts.

Plaintiffs attorney Joseph Sellers claimed that the lack of record keeping at the stores meant that the use of "a formula would be more reliable than individualized hearings." The plaintiffs love that idea because it means that companies can be accused and found guilty of discrimination merely based on statistical disparities.

But that didn't sit well with Justice Anthony Kennedy, who asked, "If Wal-Mart's process is truly 'standardless and recordless,' then why is there commonality?" As Justice Samuel Alito also put it: "So you have the company that is absolutely typical of the entire American work force, and let's say . . . there weren't any variations. Every single company exactly the same profile. Then you would say every single company is in violation" of the law? Mr. Sellers said "that could very well be the case."

The Justices were also concerned that denying the company the ability to defend itself against individual claims would violate due process, and that it could result in awards to class members who were never victims of discrimination.

"Didn't the district judge say because of the numbers we couldn't possibly have the hearing in each case on whether the particular woman was owed back pay?" asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who made her name as a lawyer arguing gender discrimination cases.

Added Justice Sonia Sotomayor: "I'm a little confused. . . . You're going to say, through my statistical model, I will be able to identify those women in the class who are deserving of pay raises. What that doesn't answer is when in this process the defendant is going to be given an opportunity to defend against that finding."

Far from being a passive enabler, Wal-Mart also had strong antidiscrimination policies in place at its stores. While individual managers may have made questionable decisions, those actions or their impact on women can't all legally be ascribed to the company. With thousands of stores across the country Chief Justice John Roberts noted, "you're going to have some bad apples."

In its 1977 Teamsters decision, the Supreme Court ruled that defendants accused of systemic discrimination have the right to address the claims of their accusers individually, and the same should apply here. Trial lawyers may have figured that targeted an unsympathetic company like Wal-Mart would offer enough political momentum to carry the day, but their legal theories are an affront to the law and common sense.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg questioned whether the plaintiffs, seeking a procedural advantage, had cut thousands of alleged victims out of potential remedies. The suit was filed under a provision that makes it easier to certify a class action, but limits compensatory damages.

Justice Ginsburg said that for women who no longer work at Wal-Mart, those compensatory damages for past wrongs are more important than ensuring future opportunities at the company. "They're not interested in" an injunction against future discrimination, "but everyone's interested in money," she said.

The plaintiffs say their statistical and anecdotal evidence should be enough to get their case before a jury. They say, for instance, that while women outnumber men 2-1 in Wal-Mart's hourly positions, the ratio is reversed in management ranks. And they say that such practices as holding staff meetings at Hooters restaurants supports their claim regarding the company's allegedly discriminatory culture.

WASHINGTON -- A sex-discrimination class action against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. appeared unlikely to survive after Tuesday's Supreme Court arguments, where justices suggested the lawsuit was unfair both to the retailer and hundreds of thousands of women who allegedly were victimized.

The suit, filed in 2001 on behalf of current and former workers whose numbers now total almost three million, alleges that Wal-Mart systematically paid women less than men and provided them fewer opportunities for promotion. Wal-Mart denies the claims and says it has a strict antidiscrimination policy.

Several justices challenged the lawsuit's premise, which alleges that Wal-Mart maintained a "pattern and practice" of discrimination -- a legal standard for liability -- by granting local managers wide discretion in employment decisions.

"I'm getting whipsawed here," Justice Antonin Scalia told Joseph Sellers, the attorney representing a half-dozen women who seek to represent the massive class.

Justice Anthony Kennedy seconded that view. On the one hand, the plaintiffs allege that "Arkansas knows everything," he said, referencing the corporation's home state. But on the other, individual managers have too much autonomy.

Mr. Sellers argued that the two pieces fit together, in that the corporate policy gave local managers unfettered discretion to underpay women. Prejudice against women employees, he said, was part of a corporate culture the company calls "the Wal-Mart Way."

Because the plaintiffs' claims are based on statistical evidence of pay and promotions that favor men over women, Justice Samuel Alito asked if that meant "every single company" in the country could potentially be in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination.

Possibly so, Mr. Sellers said.

Liberal justices were more open to the plaintiffs' theory. "Excessive subjectivity" in employment decisions could qualify as an unlawful practice, Justice Elena Kagan suggested.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg questioned whether plaintiffs, seeking a procedural advantage, had cut thousands of alleged victims out of potential remedies. The suit was filed under a provision that makes it easier to certify a class action and obtain an injunction against misconduct, but limits compensatory damages.

Justice Ginsburg said that for women who no longer work at Wal-Mart, those compensatory damages for past wrongs are more important than ensuring future opportunities at the company.

The plaintiffs are seeking back pay and punitive damages that could total billions of dollars if the class-action lawsuit is allowed to continue with its current scope.

The question before the court wasn't whether Wal-Martdiscriminated, but rather whether the millions of alleged victims, who worked in 170 job classifications across 3,400 stores, have enough in common that their claims can be fairly decided in a single action.

The plaintiffs allege that subjective personnel decisions at the store level and an absence of job postings for job promotions exist within a corporate culture "rife with gender stereotypes," according to a brief filed with the Supreme Court.

The initial suit was filed in June 2001 by six former and current female hourly workers and managers who accused the world's largest retailer of systematically denying women workers equal pay and opportunities for promotion.

For example, the women said they made less than men doing the same jobs, although they had equal or less experience.

Others said men who had been at the company less time were promoted into manager positions they were denied.

In June 2004, U.S. District Judge Martin Jenkins, in San Francisco, granted the case class status. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco voted 6-5 to permit the class action to proceed, but modified some aspects of the trial judge's ruling.

The appeals court said that women who left Wal-Mart before the original suit was filed in June 2001 shouldn't be considered part of the class, but left it up to a trial judge to consider whether to certify their claims under a different legal standard. It also ruled that the trial judge must use new legal standards in considering whether the women could pursue punitive damages.

In addition to the named plaintiffs, there are depositions from more than 100 women who tell similar stories. "We talked to hundreds more, but many were too scared to stand up," said Betty Lawrence, one of the plaintiffs lawyers on the case. "They didn't have a lot of job choices as it was and the thought of possibly losing their jobs terrified them."

A rollback at Wal-Mart

CLASS ACTIONS have been and should remain important tools to combat employment discrimination. These legal vehicles allow a small number of often brave individuals to step forward to assert grievances against their employer. These "named plaintiffs" act as proxies for a multitude of others who may have experienced similar harm. This strength-in-numbers approach can give workers the needed leverage to stop discriminatory practices or demand wages they were unfairly denied.

A class action against Wal-Mart Stores, filed nearly 10 years ago, aimed to address alleged discrimination against female employees who were denied equal pay or unfairly overlooked for promotions. Six women initially came forward; a California federal trial judge eventually allowed the suit to proceed on behalf of "all women who have worked at Wal-Mart since 1998." Roughly 1.5 million current and former female employees could be affected.

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court took up the Wal-Mart case to determine whether it should be allowed to advance. It is a close call, but on balance we think it should not in its current form.

The federal rules that govern class actions require that members of the class share "questions of law or fact [in] common"; they also require that "the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class." Lawyers for the plaintiffs argue that female employees have been hurt by the company's policy of giving managers on the local level almost unfettered discretion in personnel decisions. But if this discretion is nearly absolute, then how could the company itself be held accountable for an allegedly discriminatory nationwide policy that affects some 3,400 stores?

The diversity of the class in terms of geography and job type also raises concerns. The class includes part-time, hourly employees and salaried managers. Of the 120 or so affidavits submitted by women alleging to have been wronged, more than half came from six states; there were no claims of wrongdoing in 14 states where employees would nevertheless be included in the class action.

Fairness to all of the women involved is also an issue. Because of the way the lawsuit was crafted, the unnamed plaintiffs have had no say over whether they want to be part of the litigation. If the case proceeds as is, these women will be unable to vindicate their rights in the future, even if they have a stronger case - and stronger prospects for compensation - than the original named plaintiffs.

The court may well decide that the class as currently structured is not workable. In that case, the justices should give the women a chance to more narrowly tailor the class. They should also consider allowing individuals the opportunity to opt out. But in no case should they rule in a manner that would thwart the chances of having the women's grievances addressed.

Supreme Court justices questioned the underpinnings of a massive class-action lawsuit against Wal-Mart on Tuesday and whether female employees could show that a common, discriminatory policy governed the company's pay and promotion decisions.

Even justices who seemed sympathetic to letting the largest gender discrimination lawsuit in history proceed to trial had questions about how it might go forward.

Lawyers for women suing the nation's largest retailer built their case on affidavits from more than 100 workers and a statistical model showing that, while women make up 80 percent of the company's hourly workers, they account for only 30 percent of its managers. They allege pay discrepancies, unequal promotion policies and a male-dominated management.

But some justices said they had trouble understanding how, in the plaintiffs' view, Wal-Mart carried out its policy of discrimination.

"It's not clear to me: What is the unlawful policy that Wal-Mart has adopted, under your theory of the case?" asked Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, often the key vote on a divided court.

Joseph M. Sellers, a Washington lawyer who argued the case on behalf of Wal-Mart greeter Betty Dukes and other women, said Wal-Mart allowed great discretion to local managers to make pay and personnel decisions.

But he said the Bentonville, Ark.-based company instilled in those managers a sense of "the Wal-Mart way" that was used to "pay women less than men who were doing the same work in the same facilities at the same time . . . and provided fewer opportunities for promotion."

Kennedy was not satisfied.

"Your complaint faces in two directions. Number one, you said this is a culture where Arkansas knows, the headquarters knows, everything that's going on," Kennedy said. "Then in the next breath, you say, well, now these supervisors have too much discretion. It seems to me there's an inconsistency there."

Justice Antonin Scalia quickly picked up the theme.

"I'm getting whipsawed here," Scalia said. "On the one hand, you say the problem is that they were utterly subjective, and on the other hand you say there is a - a strong corporate culture that guides all of this. Well, which is it?"

The questions echoed Wal-Mart's argument that lower courts should not have certified a class-action suit against the company, because hiring practices and anecdotal evidence of discrimination cannot be tied to the company, which has an official policy of nondiscrimination.

"If the three named plaintiffs stand before the court, they are supposed to represent 500,000 or a million or more people," said Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., who represented Wal-Mart. "And the claim is that the individual decision-makers in those other cases exercised their discretion in a way that was biased, and there's no proof of that."

The issue before the court is not whether Wal-Mart is guilty of discrimination, but whether the women suing the company have made a compelling case that a jury should hear the issue.

The court's liberals stressed that point, and said that simply adopting a policy of nondiscrimination was not enough to insulate Wal-Mart from liability.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that even a company with such a policy must ask itself whether it is being enforced if the company receives reports "month after month" that women are underrepresented in managerial jobs and lag in pay.

"Isn't there some responsibility on the company to say, is gender discrimination at work, and if it is, isn't there an obligation to stop it?" Ginsburg asked.

Boutrous replied that Wal-Mart's study showed no pay discrepancies between men and women at 90 percent of the company's stores.

Justice Elena Kagan said she was "a little bit confused as to why excessive subjectivity is not a policy that can be alleged" as a discriminatory practice.

And Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen G. Breyer reminded that if the suit were allowed to go forward, Wal-Mart would have a chance to prove the allegations false.

"Ultimately, you may win and prove to a fact-finder that this analysis is fatally flawed," Sotomayor said, but that does not mean the justices should overturn the decision of a federal judge and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit that the case should be heard.

But even Sotomayor and Ginsburg expressed concern about the suit. Sotomayor worried that using the plaintiffs' statistical model to award back pay would limit the company's right to defend against specific allegations.

And Ginsburg said she had a "very serious problem" with the way back pay, damages, and injunctive relief from Wal-Mart's allegedly discriminatory practices were all raised in the same class action.

That could lead to a narrow decision in which the court separated the issues and sent the case back to lower courts.

But other justices had concerns beyond the procedural. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked, in effect, whether Wal-Mart is any different from other large companies.

Alito wondered whether a company would be in violation of civil rights laws if the disparities in its workforce were typical of other companies. Roberts ventured that Wal-mart might even be a little better.

"Is it true that Wal-Mart's pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?" Roberts asked Sellers.

The lawyer replied that the issue was not how Wal-Mart ranked.

"Wal-Mart's obligation . . . is to ensure that its managers do not make pay decisions because of sex, and the comparison that's relevant is between men and women at Wal-Mart, not the general population," Sellers said.

The case is Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes . A decision could come any time before the court adjourns in late June.

As the Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday over the largest job- bias class-action lawsuit in history, key justices suggested they might side with Wal-Mart rather than with the women who allege the company discriminated against them.

Justice Anthony Kennedy pressed lawyer Joseph Sellers, who represented the women suing Wal-Mart, on how potentially millions of employees could be swept into a single class-action case against the giant retailer.

"Why is there commonality" among the claims and relief sought? Kennedy asked. He said "a flaw in your case" arises from the fact that the women are making different assertions about back pay owed.

Separately, Chief Justice John Roberts suggested that a great deal of evidence showing manager bias at a company might be required before a class-action lawsuit can be filed. "I assume with ... many thousands of stores, you're going to have some bad apples," Roberts said.

The arguments played out before a packed courtroom. Spectators had begun lining up outside before midnight for seats in the public section of the red-velvet-and-white-marble courtroom. Lawyers filled the special bar section. Four of the six named women who brought the suit, including Betty Dukes and Christine Kwapnoski, were present. So were Wal-Mart corporate officials, including Gisel Ruiz, an executive vice president who oversees human resources.

The women who claim the nation's largest private company denied them promotions and higher pay are seeking to represent most women who have worked at Wal-Mart Stores since 1998. Lower-court judges estimated the class at 500,000 women; Wal-Mart says it could be as large as 1.5 million.

The women say widespread discrimination stems from a highly centralized corporate culture rife with stereotypes demeaning of women. Among the claims is that women were told to "doll up" and wear more makeup, and that business meetings were occasionally held at Hooters restaurant, where waitresses wear skimpy clothing.

The question for the nine justices Tuesday was not whether Wal- Mart discriminated but whether lower U.S. courts properly allowed the women to go forward as a class action. The answer has consequences for whether the women who say they were wronged can get into court and whether Wal-Mart would have to defend itself against a potential billion-dollar judgment.

Stakes high for business

Class actions enable one or more people to sue as representatives of a large group of people with similar interests. For workers who have little ability to come forward on their own, such lawsuits provide a way to challenge a big company. Yet corporations such as Wal-Mart say class actions must be limited by rules governing who can join together.

Appealing a lower-court decision, Wal-Mart says the class of women lacks a common set of grievances.

Wal-Mart lawyer Theodore Boutrous told the justices the group falls short of the required "cohesion," and he stressed that "the company has a very strong policy against discrimination and in favor of diversity."

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, among the justices voicing more skepticism for Wal-Mart's position, asked whether a company has a responsibility to act if it "gets reports month after month showing that women are disproportionately passed over for promotion, and there is a pay gap between men and women doing the same job." (Ginsburg gained national attention early in her legal career for representing victims of sex discrimination and helping to develop a strategy that led to enhanced constitutional protection against such bias.)

"Yes," Boutrous said, "there is an obligation for a company to do its best to ensure there are not wage gaps and discrimination. But here, for example, if one looks at the aggregated statistics that the plaintiffs have pointed to, it does not show that there were gender gaps at the stores among comparable people."

Lawsuit says pay lagged

In the women's lawsuit dating to 2001, they contend female employees' pay lagged behind that of men in every major job in each of the company's 41 regions. While women made up more than 80% of hourly supervisors, the women say, they held only one-third of store management jobs.

Boutrous has disputed those statistics, and he stressed Tuesday that the women suing lack legal grounds to connect workers at thousands of stores, with hundreds of managers, in one gigantic claim.

Justice Elena Kagan, who also pressed Boutrous, suggested the women had identified a "common policy ... of complete subjectivity" among managers leading to sex discrimination.

"All that the plaintiffs have to demonstrate and, especially at this stage in the proceedings," she said, "is that there is a practice, a policy of subjectivity, that on the whole results in discrimination against women," Kagan said.

During his time at the lectern, Sellers argued for the women, "Wal-Mart provided to its managers unchecked discretion ... that was used to pay women less than men who were doing the same work in the same facilities at the same time, even though those women had more seniority and higher performance."

Kennedy, a frequent key vote on the court, responded skeptically, saying, "No.1, you said this is a culture where ... the headquarters knows everything that's going on. Then in the next breath, you say, 'Well, now these supervisors have too much discretion.' It seems to me there's an inconsistency there, and I'm just not sure what the unlawful policy is."

Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito also pressed Sellers on that point.

Sellers responded that managers have broad discretion, yet the overall Wal-Mart corporate culture stereotypes women.

After the hearing, Dukes, who joined Wal-Mart in 1994 and now works as a greeter at a store in Pittsburg, Calif., said she was "gratified by the chance to be at the Supreme Court, and no matter what the justices decide, we feel we have made a difference. It is my hope that our daughters ... will not have to go through what we did."

Ruiz of Wal-Mart said she thought the company was able to show the justices it had "a strong non-discrimination policy ... and to illustrate the other flaws in the plaintiffs' theories."

Lawyers who have represented employees and management in class- action cases said the justices' questions appeared to favor Wal- Mart.

David Sanford, a Washington, D.C., lawyer, represented women who won a $250 million punitive damages award from the drug company Novartis last year.

He said the Wal-Mart case offers the court a chance "to reaffirm the rights of women in the workplace. Unfortunately, from the questions of some of the justices, the Supreme Court may roll back those rights."

Mark Batten, a Boston lawyer who has represented management in class actions, said, "The court's questions suggest that an outright affirmance of the lower court is unlikely, but it is difficult to assess how broad the court's opinion will be."

A decision in Wal-Mart v. Dukes is likely by the end of June, when the justices usually recess.

Treatment of women at issue in Wal-Mart case

Several U.S. Supreme Court justices sharply questioned on Tuesday whether female employees at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. can proceed with the largest class-action sexdiscrimination lawsuit in history that seeks billions of dollars.

At issue in the case was whether a small group of women who began the lawsuit 10 years ago against the world's largest retailer can represent a huge nationwide class that could total millions of women.

After lawyers for Wal-Mart and for the employees presented arguments, a crowd of protesters outside the Supreme Court shouted "fair pay now" and carried signs such as "Stop discounting the women of Wal-Mart" and "The women of Wal-Mart are not worthless."

Chris Kwapnoski, a 24-year Wal-Mart employee and one of the named plaintiffs in the case, confidently told reporters after the arguments, "We're not going to lose."

She recalled being told by a manager to "brush the cobwebs off" and "doll up" if she wanted to advance.

After listening to the attorneys, the top court took the case under advisement, with a ruling expected by late June. The decision could change the legal landscape for other class-action lawsuits. During the session, some justices strongly questioned the arguments by the plaintiffs.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, a moderate conservative who often casts the decisive vote on the nine-member court, said, "I'm just not sure what the unlawful policy is."

Justice Antonin Scalia described as inconsistent the argument by the plaintiffs that Wal-Mart had a strong corporate culture that fostered stereotypes of women while at the same time giving local store managers too much discretion in pay and promotion decisions.

Scalia questioned whether it would be fair to the company for the case to proceed. "Is this really due process?" he asked.

Wal-Mart's attorney, Theodore Boutrous, who argued the case, said female employees in different jobs and in different stores do not have enough in common to be in a single class-action lawsuit.

"It's not fair to anyone to bring this in one big class," he told the justices.

Joseph Sellers, an attorney for the women, argued the class-action lawsuit should be allowed to go to trial for a decision on the merits of the claims. "This is an extraordinary case," he said.

Betty Dukes, a Wal-Mart employee in Pittsburg, Calif., for whom the case has been named, attended the arguments, along with Kwapnoski.

"Without a class action, I wouldn't be able to do anything about the discrimination. Wal-Mart is just too big. A class action gives us a fair shot. That is all we ask for," Dukes said.

Women's groups have said a Wal-Mart victory could signal a significant retreat for women's rights in the workplace.

Businesses said a Wal-Mart defeat could make every large corporation vulnerable to sweeping allegations of employment bias and would water down class-action requirements.

Legal experts and financial analysts said if Wal-Mart loses in the Supreme Court and at trial, the retailer with more than $400 billion in sales has enough cash to make a big payout.

NEW YORK, March 30 -- Selected editorial excerpts from the U.S. press:

THE WAL-MART WATERSHED (The Wall Street Journal, New York)

The justices of the Supreme Court were not taking prisoners on Tuesday as the court heard oral arguments in an enormous employment discrimination suit against retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. If their skepticism is any guide, it may presage the end of a vast new plaintiffs lawyer jackpot.

In Wal-Mart Stores vs. Dukes, the justices will decide whether thousands of women who have worked for Wal-Mart may be certified as a class in an employment discrimination case against the company. If the case is allowed to proceed, it would lump together disparate cases as evidence of systemic discrimination by the world's largest retailer, with potential liability in the billions.

That prospect has implications well beyond Wal-Mart, which employs 1.4 million Americans. Trial lawyers love class-action suits, which typically involve business products, because they increase the incentive for companies to settle -- and thus advance the chances of a big lawyer payday. Discrimination cases are especially unsuited to class status, however, because they involve individual behavior. If the lawyers can ring up Wal-Mart for monetary awards based on a matrix of statistics, economic models and adventures in sociology, every company in America could soon be a target.

Wal-Mart employee Betty Dukes and five other women first alleged discrimination in 2001, and the lawyers have been trying to expand that to encompass every woman who has worked at Wal-Mart since 1998. Last April, a divided en banc panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a district judge's ruling that allowed the case to proceed as a class. Liberals hope the case will be a seminal moment for gender discrimination claims, and the Obama administration filed an amicus brief on the Ninth Circuit supporting the women.

But as the Supreme Court seemed to agree yesterday, finding commonality among so many far flung cases is not easy. For example, the plaintiffs lawyers have alleged that some women were victimized by a supervisor's decision to hold a business lunch at Hooters, a restaurant chain known for its, er, waitresses. Another woman complained that her manager tended to yell at her, but not at her male counterparts.

In its 1977 Teamsters decision, the Supreme Court ruled that defendants accused of systemic discrimination have the right to address the claims of their accusers individually, and the same should apply here. Trial lawyers may have figured that targeted an unsympathetic company like Wal-Mart would offer enough political momentum to carry the day, but their legal theories are an affront to the law and common sense.

Justices question; Walmart bias suit

WASHINGTON - A skeptical Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in the largest employment discrimination case in history, suggesting that the massive, decade-old class-action suit against Walmart Stores Inc. may have run aground at what could be its final stop.

The suit accuses the retailer of systematically discriminating against potentially millions of its employees in terms of pay and promotion and has been closely watched both by workplace advocates and corporate America. A victory for the plaintiffs could unleash a flood of similar suits that seek to prove discrimination through the broader use of statistical models rather than direct evidence, and a win for Walmart would be greeted with relief by large employers nationwide.

The issue before the justices involves whether the plaintiffs can sue together as a sprawling class - all women who worked for the chain since 1998 - or whether their discrimination claims are too diverse to be banded together in a single action. Both a trial court and the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco green-lighted the case. The plaintiffs maintain that individual suits against Walmart would be too costly and difficult to pursue.

But although the more conservative- leaning justices on the high court seemed the most hostile to the case, nearly all its members appeared troubled by aspects of the litigation, with concerns including how back pay would be awarded to plaintiffs and whether the company would be afforded ample opportunity to present evidence of nondiscrimination at trial.

A key, at least for what appeared to be a majority of justices, is whether Walmart as a company had in place policies that encouraged supervisors to treat women employees differently than men. The company's attorney, Theodore J. Boutrous of Los Angeles, argued that the company instead took a strong stand against discrimination, and that any case of disparate pay or treatment was the product of rogue managers.

"They haven't shown a pattern across the map," Boutrous said.

Several justices, too, seemed critical of contention by the lawyer for the plaintiffs, Joseph M. Sellers, that Walmart faced liability because it allowed its managers too much leeway in hiring and pay decisions.

"Walmart provided to its managers unchecked discretion ... that was used to pay men more than women," Sellers said.

That troubled Justice Antonin Scalia, who could not reconcile the notion of unbridled individual managers applying highly subjective standards to hiring decisions with the argument that Walmart, as a company, discriminated as part of a corporate policy.

"Which is it?" Scalia said. "It's either individual supervisors who are left on their own or there is a strong corporate culture that tells you what to do.

"If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion, you don't have discretion," Scalia said.

Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. also wondered whether the company should be subject to a class action because, among thousands of stores, "you're going to have some bad apples."

Boutrous, representing Walmart, also argued that the plaintiffs' claims were too dissimilar - the class encompasses 170 separate job classifications - to be tried together.

"Each of the plaintiffs have very different stories," Boutrous said. "It's not fair to anyone to put this all into one big class."

But Justice Stephen Breyer reminded his colleagues that they weren't passing judgment on the merits of the plaintiffs' claims, but merely whether such a large suit can be brought to trial. "We're just talking about getting your foot in the door," he said.

The three women on the court, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, appeared to be most sympathetic to the plaintiffs' case, with Ginsburg suggesting that Walmart could be liable if it knew of widespread discrimination and did nothing to check it.

"Isn't there some responsibility on the company to say, 'Is gender discrimination at work?' And if there is, isn't there an obligation to stop it?" Ginsburg asked. But even they worried aloud about issues revolving around back pay and other relief and whether plaintiffs would be barred from pursuing separate claims for economic damages. Sotomayor, in particular, seemed troubled by the plaintiffs' intention to use statistical models to award back pay if the plaintiffs prevailed, which, she said, might not give the company any opportunity to contest individual instances of discrimination.

Those concerns left open the possibility that, rather than a divided court issuing an opinion in a highly charged case involving sex discrimination, the justices could decide to remand the case to the lower court under a revised set of guidelines.

The Supreme Court justices suggested that they're troubled that a lower court allowed a class-action sex discrimination lawsuit to proceed against the world's biggest retailer, sending the suit to the top court. The suit, on behalf of at least 500,000 women, says Wal-Mart (WMT) favors men over women in pay and promotions. Billions of dollars are at stake in the case, creating pressure on Wal-Mart to settle. Wal-Mart denies it discriminated. A decision is expected by summer. Wal-Mart edged up 0.1% to 52.26.

The SCOTUS heard whether female employees will be allowed to sue Wal-Mart en masse in a giant class action that could encompass millions of plaintiffs, in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. v. Dukes on 3/29  (Kaplan, National Journal, 3/29)

Justices Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor, perhaps the "strongest supporters of the class action," led the questioning of Wal-Mart atty Theodore Boutrous (Stohr/McQuillen, Bloomberg, 3/29)  The questioning focused on whether "the women attempting to sue the largest private employer in the country lacked the cohesion necessary for a class action" (National Journal, 3/29)

Boutrous argued "that Wal-Mart would not be able to adequately defend itself against charges of discrimination because the nature of each case is so different." Justice Antonin Scalia seemed to agree.

Scalia: “Is this really due process?”

Scalia and Justice Anthony Kennedy also expressed skepticism that "Wal-Mart promulgated a culture of discrimination." Plaintiff atty Joseph Sellers stated "that the company told managers who were in training that women were not promoted as often as men because men were more aggressive."

Kennedy found the argument unpersuasive: “It's not clear to me:  What is the unlawful policy that Wal-Mart has adopted, under your theory of the case?" (Barnes, Washington Post, 3/29).

Northwestern University law professor Martin Redish: "This Supreme Court is known as being a very pro-business court. I think in a lot of those decisions, the legal arguments happen to favor the business. I would be shocked if they uphold this class” (National Journal, 3/29).

AZ Campaign Law In Jeopardy

SCOTUS justices "signaled during oral arguments" 3/28 "that they would vote to strike down (AZ's) campaign funding law" (see 3/29's Hotline).

The disputed provision provides "matching funds" to candidates competing against a well-funded and free-spending opponent.

Chief Justice John Roberts' rationale for striking down the AZ law:  "Under our precedents, leveling the playing field is not a legitimate state purpose. I checked the Citizens Clean Elections Commission website this morning, and it says that this act was passed to 'level the playing field' when it comes to running for office. Why isn't that clear evidence that it's unconstitutional?" (Savage, Los Angeles Times, 3/29)

The SCOTUS has previously "split 5-4 on campaign funding cases, with the conservative bloc in the majority." Kennedy, "expected to provide the decisive vote," seemed inclined to support his conservative colleagues (Sullum, New York Post, 3/30).

The ruling "could affect campaign laws in several states," including ME, CT and FL.

The SCOTUS is "unlikely to hand down a decision in the Arizona case until June" (Los Angeles Times, 3/29).

SCOTUS Overturns Exonerated Man's Settlement

The SCOTUS on 3/29 "stripped a $14 million award from a wrongfully convicted man who had spent 14 years on death row and successfully sued New Orleans prosecutors for misconduct."Conservative justices "prevailed" in the 5 to 4 ruling," shielding the district attorney’s office from liability "for not turning over evidence that showed John Thompson’s innocence."

Conservative justices "prevailed" in the 5 to 4 ruling," shielding the district attorney’s office from liability "for not turning over evidence that showed John Thompson’s innocence."  The court's ruling highlighted the ideological division between the 9 justices.

Justice Clarence Thomas said Thompson could not show a pattern of “deliberate indifference” on the part of former district attorney Harry Connick Sr. in training his staff to turn over evidence to the defense team.

Joined by Justices Stephen Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan, Ginsberg wrote:  “I would uphold the jury’s verdict awarding damages to Thompson for the gross, deliberately indifferent and long-continuing violation of his fair trial right” (Barnes, Washington Post, 3/29).  

Not Your Father's NAACP

The NAACP is making a concerted--and successful effort--to diversify its leadership ranks. In MA, the local Worcester chapter "elected a 28-year-old openly gay black man as its president this month." In NJ, a branch of the organization "chose a Honduran immigrant to lead it last year." And in MS, the Jackson State University chapter "recently turned to a 30-something white man."

Clark Univ. prof. Ravi Perry:  "This is the new NAACP. This is a human rights organization, and we have an obligation to fight discrimination at all levels."

NAACP's leadership has broadened the organization's focus from racial injustice and spurred an increase in paid membership (Contreras, USA Today, 3/30)

Conservative judges on the US Supreme Court sharply challenged lawyers attempting to bring the biggest sex discrimination case in history as a key hearing on the case got underway in Washington.

The court's justices are set to decide by June whether lawyers representing potentially more than a million women employed by Walmart can bring a class-action sex-discrimination lawsuit against the retail giant. Their decision looks set to redefine discrimination cases in the US.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, a moderate conservative, and Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative judge, questioned the basis of the case. Kennedy said Walmart's record on pay and promotion was better than the US average.

The potentially liability in the case could reach billions of dollars. The suit began nearly 10 years ago when it was originally filed on behalf of employee Betty Dukes and five of her co-workers. Walmart is appealing an earlier court's decision to let the case go to trial.

Joseph Sellers, a lawyer representing the women, said Walmart, owner of Asda in the UK, has a corporate culture that stereotypes women and that has led to discrimination in pay and promotion.

"These decisions are informed by the values the company provides," Sellers said. He added that earlier courts had been persuaded by this argument and a wealth of statistical evidence that there was a class action case to be answered.

Scalia attacked Sellers position, saying he was "whipsawed" by the argument that either individual managers are on their own, "or else a strong corporate culture tells them what to do".

Legal expert Stuart Slotnick of New York law firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney said it was too early to tell which way the judges would vote but it was clear that the statistical element in the case was "causing concerns".

"There needs to be other evidence than a mathematical analysis of pay scales." He said evidence, such as testimony from employees about a sexist corporate culture or a policy of discrimination, would bolster the case.

The plaintiffs were given some support by justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She said the issue being decided was whether the case has enough evidence to proceed and not if discrimination could be immediately proven.

Wal-Mart plans return to its one-stop roots

The world's largest retailer needs to get back to its roots as the lowest priced one-stop-shop for consumers, Wal-Mart's U.S. CEO Bill Simon told USA TODAY on Wednesday

Wal-Mart, which has had seven-consecutive quarters of sales declines in the U.S., erred in cutting back on the number of products it offers and getting away from its theme of everyday low prices, Simon says.

Costly remodels of stores made it difficult for Wal-Mart to lower prices as much or as often as it would have normally. These factors prompted customers to flee to competitors, Simon says.

Efforts to streamline its inventory by reducing the number of brands of, say, tools, also hit the company hard. Simon says customers who might have browsed for hardware on their once-diverse shelves stopped coming, so the store is bringing back the brands it dropped.

Other plans:

- The huge cut proposed by the Federal Reserve Board in the fees retailers pay on debit card transactions would reduce Wal-Mart's costs enough that it could cut prices. "Any reduction in cost or expense anywhere goes to the customer," Simon says.

- Wal-Mart is considering whether it needs to polish its image a bit after the drubbing it's taken on its sex discrimination case before the Supreme Court.

The company's female managers have complained that their success stories have not been adequately told, he says.

- Wal-Mart will open 30 to 40 smaller format stores this year. About half will be about 15,000-square-foot Walmart Express stores, and half will be 30,000- to 60,000-square-foot "neighborhood markets" that are full-scale grocery stores. Walmart Supercenters are now about 180,000 square feet.

Simon says Wal-Mart was able to hang onto many of the higher- income customers it attracted during the recession.

Its missteps in pricing and product selection drove some of these customers away, but at about the same rate it turned off lower- income shoppers, he says.

John Long, a retail strategist with consulting firm Kurt Salmon, says Wal-Mart's strategy to keep wealthier customers "didn't work too well."

But he believes bigger factors may be at play.

"Everybody thought the intensity and depth of the recession might produce remarkable behavior shifts," Long says.

"To some degree they may have, but they are more attitudinal in nature than loyalty related."

Walmart hits back at women's claim

Discrimination case in Supreme Court

Lawsuit centres on pay and promotion

Walmart has launched a counter attack against a small group of women seeking in the Supreme Court to represent more than 1m of the US discount retailer's current and former employees in the world's largest sex discrimination case.

In a class-action lawsuit that has taken a decade to reach the court, the retailer is accused of paying women in the US less than men for the same work and of passing them over for promotion.

The case has the potential to transform the course of legal disputes between big business and workers in the US by establishing legal precedents that would have wide-ranging implications.

Walmart, the world's biggest retailer by sales, has been an active opponent of unions and is no stranger to legal disputes in the US and overseas, which often become highly politicised because of its size and influence.

On Tuesday, the court heard arguments on whether the case should be allowed to go forward with six original plaintiffs seeking to represent a larger group of current and former employees estimated to number up to 1.5m.

Theodore Boutros, the lead lawyer for Walmart, told the Supreme Court: "It's not fair to anyone that this is one big class [action]." Individuals who felt discriminated against by the company should be dealt with case by case, he said. The court is expected to issue a ruling by July. Walmart claims the class action is too broadly constituted to be meaningful. Its corporate allies say that if the case is allowed to go forward, corporate America will be hobbled by classaction lawsuits.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs - led by 61-year-old Betty Dukes, who still works for Walmart - say a victory on this technical point would give US workers better legal protection against discrimination.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs, who say the women's experiences reflect a wider culture of discrimination at Walmart, were challenged aggressively by the judges on Tuesday.

One of the justices, Anthony Kennedy, who is seen as the crucial "wavering vote", told the plaintiffs' lawyer: "Your argument looks in two directions. You say headquarters know everything that is going on; then you say [local managers] have too much discretion."

David Tovar, a Walmart spokesman, said Ms Dukes and her fellow plaintiffs could not be representative of more than 1m women. "We think there are thousands of women who have had tremendously positive experiences working at Walmart," he said, adding that the group had had antidiscrimination policies in place for many years.

Joseph Sellers, for the plaintiffs, said before the arguments: "Walmart has repeatedly argued that this case is too big to be adjudicated properly. I worry that they are seeking a standard that would make companies too big to be accountable."

His team has supplemented evidence with testimony from other Walmart employees and statistical analysis that it says shows women are not paid as well or promoted as often as men. Walmart says the extra evidence is flawed.

Several big companies have rallied to Walmart's side. The US Chamber of Commerce said last year that if the case went ahead, "an avalanche of new class-action litigation" could engulf companies in the US.

Meanwhile, opponents of Walmart reject the suggestion that defeat for the retailer would shift power from big business to litigants.

Instead, they say, it is a Walmart victory that would upend established legal tradition.
